    <p><span class="label1">Sweet fennel</span> is best known for its
      distinct licorice aroma and taste; yet its ability to relieve
      occasional indigestion and digestive troubles, as well as easing
      monthly menstrual cycles are equally noteworthy.&nbsp; It also
      supports a healthy lymphatic system and calms minor skin
      irritations. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em class="noLink">Foeniculum vulgare</em> is a flowering plant
        species, in the celery family (<span class="noLink">Apiaceae</span>
        or <span class="noLink">Umbelliferae</span>).&nbsp; An upright,
        branching perennial, that can grow up to six feet in height, it
        has delicate, feathery leaves.&nbsp; It is typically grown in
        vegetable and herb gardens, for its licorice or anise-flavored
        seeds. </p>
      <p>Used for centuries, for its many health benefits, the history
        of <span class="label1">fennel</span> dates back to ancient
        times, when Roman warriors were said to have consumed it, to
        make them strong and ready for battle. </p>
      <p><span class="label1">Sweet fennel</span>'s oil is steam

        seeds, and yields an oil with a sweet, honey-like, yet spicy,
        aroma, with familiar licorice or anise notes.&nbsp; It is often
        used to relieve occasional indigestion and digestive troubles,
        and to support a healthy lymphatic system. </p>
