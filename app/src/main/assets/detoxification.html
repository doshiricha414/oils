                <h3>Isolated Cleanses</h3>
                <p>A more aggressive, time period specific cleanse that
                  may address<br>
                  one area of the body.</p>
                <h4>Herxheimer reactions</h4>
                <p>Since Isolated Cleanses are oft time an aggressive
                  approach to cleansing body organs they can release
                  massive quantities of toxins that have been within the
                  body, especially from those that have had health
                  problems.&nbsp; These released toxins can cause
                  uncomfortable reactions as they exit the body through
                  the bowels or skin.&nbsp; Some may experience
                  digestive disruption, others rashes or other skin
                  disorders.&nbsp; The general advice is to slow the
                  cleanse by reducing or spacing the cleansing agents to
                  find a comfortable level, but to continue the
                  cleanse.&nbsp; Also consider a period of preparation
                  with a nutritional cleanse as described above.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>GX Assist</h4>
                <p>GX Assist is a combination of essential oils and
                  caprylic acid for cleansing the gastro intestinal
                  tract.&nbsp; It includes Oregano, Melaleuca, Lemon,
                  Lemongrass, Peppermint, and Thyme essential oils.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  3 GX Assist capsules daily for 10 days.&nbsp; Best
                  taken with meals.&nbsp; If uncomfortable reactions
                  reduce the number of daily capsules.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  Follow with PB Assist, a probiotic, to build healthy

                <h4>Candida Cleanse</h4>
                <p>This is a cleanse similar to the GX Assist but using
                  individual essential oils.&nbsp; It also is highly
                  effective against Candida or yeast infections that
                  affect many.</p>

                <h4>The Master Cleanse or Lemonade Diet <span></span></h4>
                <p>The Master Cleanser is a way to cleanse the body of
                  toxins and reduce the cravings we experience from
                  eating junk food. The cleanse involves drinking only
                  Lemonade made from fresh Lemon juice, Grade B/Medium
                  maple syrup, water and Cayenne Pepper. No solid food
                  can be eaten for the duration of the cleanse. The
                  Lemonade is best taken at room temperature. The master
                  cleanse is technically not a "fast" and proponents say
                  it is more gentle on the body because it does contain
                  some essential vitamins and minerals. According to
                  proponents it is recommended to be on the cleanse for
                  a minimum of ten days, but it is not uncommon for
                  people to stay on the cleanse for longer periods of
                  time, even as long as 45 days. A good indicator of
                  when you should end the cleanse is when the coating on
                  your tongue clears up and your tongue is nice and pink
                  in the morning. This indicates that your body has
                  cleared out most toxins. But you must judge for
                  yourself when to end the diet.&nbsp; For me,
                  personally, I experience a high influx of energy and a
                  feeling of euphoria after about the 2nd or 3rd week.</p>
                <p>The following quantities of each ingredient are
                  required (some adjustment may be required for
                  non-average sized people, large or small.) These
                  amounts are for all the Lemonade you need for 1 day
                  that is 2 quarts.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  14 Tablespoons Lemon Juice</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  14 Tablespoons (Grade B) Maple Syrup</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  1/2 Teaspoon Cayenne Pepper – or to taste (as much as
                  you can stand)</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  2 quarts of water</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  Drink at room temperature.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  10 to 45 days are mentioned</p>
                <p>Since there is no intake of solid food, special
                  precautions are taken to avoid constipation. Laxative
                  tea, which is optional, is taken every night, and in
                  the morning a quick drink of 32 ounces of lukewarm sea
                  salt water (about 1heaping&nbsp; tablespoon or sea
                  salt).&nbsp; This passes will pass through the
                  digestive system extremely quickly, be near a
                  bathroom, you will need it usually within 30-60
                  minutes. Many individuals don't require the laxative
                  tea as long as the salt water has the desired effect.
                  (and you can take it.&nbsp; It's not fun drinkng warm
                  salt water)</p>
                <p>It is essential to go off of the cleanse slowly. The
                  lack of solid foods for such long periods requires
                  careful breaking, as gut flora need to re-develop and
                  mucus linings re-build. This usually involves drinking
                  "full strength" juices for a day or two, while slowly
                  adding in soups, then fruit, vegetables and nuts
                  before resuming a regular diet. I would definitly use
                  the PB Assist probiotics during the cleanse to help
                  re-establish a healthy intestinal culture.&nbsp; Some
                  individuals have returned to their healthy diet the
                  following day after stopping the program without any
                  problems, but this is rare and not recommended
                  especially for first timers.</p>
                <p>Others also recommend coupling the Master Cleanse
                  with Metabolic Blend or Grapefruit water (1 to 2 drops
                  in 8 ounces of water) and/or the Massage Blend
                  Technique.&nbsp; Also topical application of essential
                  oils directly to the area of the liver with warm
                  compresses (Helichrysum, etc.).</p>
