(see diagram) The reason for the growth of these fibroid tumors is not understood but some suggest they are linked to the hormone estrogen.&nbsp; They occur in the majority of women but often go undetected because they are very small or cause no noticeable symptoms.&nbsp;</p><p>Typically if they develop during child bearing years there will be more than one and they will slowly grow. They can be a factor in heavy menstrual bleeding and/or menstrual discomfort but seldom are they a factor in uterine cancer or do they become cancerous tumors.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; DDR Prime, <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/geranium" class="button halfsize">Geranium</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/sandalwood" class="button halfsize">Sandalwood</a></p><p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong> GX Assist, PB Assist</p><p><strong>Also consider: </strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/cypress" class="button halfsize">Cypress</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/eucalyptusRadiata" class="button halfsize">Eucalyptus</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/rosemary" class="button halfsize">Rosemary</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center"> </h3><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Dr. David K. Hill in his presentation on Hormonal Grounding Blend gives this important observation, <em>"Frankincense should also be considered for disorders of the uterus such as fibroid cysts, etc.&nbsp; Use it to reduce existing abnormalities or consider it to prevent their formation.&nbsp; Frankincense will also balance the endocrine system.&nbsp; Use it by placing 2 or 3 drops under the tongue every night and every morning."</em></p><p>Dr. Hill and others suggest there is a connection between uterine fibroids and candida and suggest the candida cleanse using GX Assist&nbsp; and PB Assist.&nbsp; Also see <a class="button halfsize" href="#/tab/conditions/candida-yeast-infection">Candida</a>.</p><p>Others suggest at the onset using Frankincense internally by placing 6 - 8 drops on the end of a tampon, others have used the Frankincense in a capsule and filled the remainder with FCO and inserted it vaginally just before retiring. Also take LLV and DDR Prime (2 capsules) daily and after the bleeding is controlled continue with Frankincense under the tongue daily.</p><p><strong>Pain and Cramps </strong>- here are two protocols folks have found successful:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; -&nbsp; Take 8 -12 drops of Sandalwood internally in a capsule at the outset.&nbsp; On the second day take 6 - 8 drops of Sandalwood in a capsule.</p><p>&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; Apply 2 - 4 drops each of Cypress and Rosemary topically to the abdomen.&nbsp; Use a warm compress on abdomen after applying oils.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
