                  <h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Make dietary and exercise changes
                    in your life that make a healthy body a priority.
                    This may take time, for some… years. But it is by
                    far the best step you can take towards normalized
                    blood pressure. There are many sources that can
                    teach you foods that are best for elevated blood
                    pressure. Take advantage of these. If you smoke or
                    drink alcohol, stop. It’s one of the worst things
                    you can do for elevated blood pressure. Remove high
                    fat, fried, high fructose corn syrup products and
                    carbonated drinks completely from your diet.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Exercise daily. Park a few blocks
                    from work. Get a dog and walk it daily. Go for a
                    walk with a son, daughter or spouse every night
                    after dinner.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Use&nbsp; Life Long Vitality
                    supplements daily.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Use a reduced amount of quality sea
                    salt or whole mineral salt for seasoning foods.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Find essential oils that are
                    effective at reducing high blood pressure for YOU.
                    This will take testing, and patience. The following
                    has shown success.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 drops each Basil,
                    Lavender, Marjoram in a capsule daily. Each person
                    is different and may respond to other oils.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You need a BP cuff. You
                    should have one anyway. As you try a new essential
                    oil or blend, take your BP before and after in
                    varying intervals. Try 5 min, 1 hr, 8 hrs and 16
                    hrs. Try applying oils hourly, every 8 hrs and every
                    24 hours. Keep a record of your results.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NOTE: </strong> This
                    is a serious condition and if control is not
                    achieved seek professional medical help.</p>
                  <p>The following are a list of essential oils that
                    have historically been used to help regulate high
                    blood pressure. There are also some “blends” that
                    some have found successful. And finally, I’ve
                    included the blend that I personally use with
                    success, again keeping in mind that the causes of my
                    hypertension (adrenal) are considered rare.</p>

                  <p>Recommended applications include several drops
                    applied with massage to the bottom of the feet, on
                    the wrists, along the breast bone, massage over the
                    heart, on the carotidal arteries, and to the back of
                    the neck. Also diffusion might be effective, and
                    adding the oil or blend to a bath (agitating the
                    water often).</p>
