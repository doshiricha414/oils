                  <p>The common cold is not as simple as the name
                    implies since there are hundreds of different types
                    of viruses that can cause this infection.&nbsp; Each
                    one may have slightly different
                    symptoms.&nbsp;&nbsp; The various forms of flu, like
                    a cold, are also viral infections of the upper
                    respiratory tract but have more severe
                    symptoms.&nbsp; The symptoms commonly associated
                    with a cold can include:&nbsp; cough, mild fever,
                    runny nose, sore throat, or stuffy nose.&nbsp; Some
                    cold symptoms may be confused with allergies but
                    allergies usually do not include a fever and will
                    typically last for a longer period of time.</p>

                  <p><strong>Antiviral: </strong>Frankincense,
                    Melaleuca, Oregano, Protective Blend (or numerous
                    other oils, remember the virus can be any one of
                    hundreds) are antiviral.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>2 to 4 drops applied topically to the bottoms of
                    the feet, chest, or throat or internally by gargling
                    or in a capsule. (Remember oils taken internally
                    have to pass thru the intestinal walls and the liver
                    before getting into the blood stream whereas
                    topically applied oils are delivered into the
                    bloodstream within seconds.)&nbsp; For internal use
                    with children consider a spoonful of honey with one
                    or two drops of the chosen oil. Begin using oils at
                    the first signs for the most successful outcome.</p>
                  <p><em>Note: Oregano (also Cinnamon and Thyme) is a
                      "hot" oil meaning it can cause skin or other
                      irritations with those that may be sensitive. Use
                      fewer drops and/or dilute with a <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil or
                      consider alternatives if you suspect sensitivity.</em></p>
                  <p><strong>Fever: </strong>Eucalyptus, Peppermint
                    topically applied to forehead, chest, or feet.</p>
                  <p><strong>Nasal congestion: </strong>Respiratory
                    Blend, Lavender, Peppermint inhaled via a diffuser
                    or the simple cup and inhale technique.</p>
                  <p><strong>Cough and chest congestion:</strong>
                    Cypress, Eucalyptus, Lime, Melaleuca, or Peppermint
                    applied topical to the chest or with a lymph
                    massage.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <h4><span>Prevention:</span></h4>
                  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wash your hands often
                  with soap and water, especially after you cough sneeze
                  or wipe your nose. &nbsp;Tissues should be discarded
                  immediately in a wastebasket.<br>
                  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cover your nose and
                  mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Discard
                  the tissue immediately in a waste basket.<br>
                  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Run your diffuser
                  often in your home. What oils? &nbsp;Protective Blend
                  for sure. &nbsp;It was developed to boost our immune
                  systems, and guard us against pathogens. &nbsp;I hear
                  it humming away right now as I write.<br>
                  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also consider rubbing
                  your own children’s feet with Protective Blend every
                  night before bed time and every morning before they
                  put there shoes on for the day. &nbsp;Not only is it a
                  bonding experience for you and your children, but it
                  will bolster there immune systems.<br>
                  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mist your family’s bed
                  sheets with a mist of essential oils before bedtime.
                  &nbsp;10 drops of Protective Blend or some other
                  essential oil with a ¼ cup of water in a spray bottle
                  – shake well.<br>
                  6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If there is virus in
                  your area, obviously you want to avoid contact with
                  those that are sick.<br>
                  7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Put about 1 drop of
                  Lemon oil for every 8oz of water you and your family
                  drink. &nbsp;Over time this will greatly strengthen
                  the immune system. &nbsp;In our home, we have not had
                  colds or flu of any significance in over a year since
                  we started incorporating essential oils in our
                  household. &nbsp;And this is one way we have been
                  consistent with.<br>
                  8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As always, as you
                  clean regularly around your home, use essential oils
                  to clean. &nbsp;Cleansing Blend, On guard or Lemon in
                  a spray bottle used for cleaning will assure pathogen
                  free surfaces.<br>
                  9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Be aware and
                  recognize symptoms if they strike you or a family
                  member. &nbsp;Immediately begin an essential oil
                  protocol and see a professional if you experience
                  symptoms. Swine flu symptoms are similar to regular
                  flu: Fever, body aches, sore throat, cough, runny
                  nose, vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy.<br>
                  10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make your home a happy
                  place, free from stress. &nbsp;A haven with kind words
                  and positive thoughts. &nbsp;Make a place of safety
                  and refuge. &nbsp;As storms rage on, have your home be
                  a house of prayer, gratitude and love. These are all
                  things we can do that will create of synergy of
                  protection for your home and family.

                  <h4><span>If you have symptoms</span>:</h4>
                  <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make 00 size capsules of 8
                    drops Oregano, 5 drops on guard and 3 drops
                    Frankincense. &nbsp;Then take the capsules
                    internally twice daily.</p>
                  <p><em>Note: Oregano (also Cinnamon and Thyme) is a
                      "hot" oil meaning it can cause skin or other
                      irritations with those that may be sensitive. Use
                      fewer drops and/or dilute with a <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil or
                      consider alternatives if you suspect sensitivity.</em></p>
                  <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gargle twice daily with 1 drop
                    Oregano, 2 drops on guard, and 2 drops Lemon in 1 or
                    2 tbsp of pure water. &nbsp;After gargling for 5-10
                    minutes, swallow the mixture.</p>
                  <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Oil pull daily with 1 tbsp
                    VCO, 2 drops Oregano, and 2 drops Melaleuca.
                    &nbsp;Pull for about 10 minutes before expectorating
                    the blend. Then brush your teeth and rinse out your
                    mouth. &nbsp;This mixture may be hot. &nbsp;If it’s
                    too hot, reduce the Oregano to 1 drop and add a drop
                    of Lemon. &nbsp;You can also consider Cinnamon,
                    Cassia or Protective Blend instead of Melaleuca.</p>
                  <p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Always put Lemon and
                    Peppermint in your drinking water and drink it
                    often. &nbsp;Staying hydrated is an important part
                    of assuring the oils work effectively in our bodies.</p>
                  <p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider other protocols for
                    specific symptoms. &nbsp;Respiratory Blend to the
                    chest, neck and back for respiratory issues,
                    Digestive Blend (often in a capsule with
                    Frankincense) for nausea or digestive problems.
                    &nbsp;Oregano or Cinnamon and Lemon as a gargle for
                    sore throats.</p>
                  <p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure the oils you
                    have are certified therapeutic grade essential oils.
                    Why? &nbsp;They are guaranteed to be sourced from
                    the area’s in which the are indigenous to.
                    &nbsp;They are organically grown. &nbsp;Harvested by
                    correct methods and at the correct time.
                    &nbsp;Distilled by professionals at the correct
                    temperature and pressure. &nbsp;Finally each batch
                    is tested by independent labs for correct
                    constituents content to guarantee efficacy.
                    &nbsp;These methods are key to insuring safety and
                    effectiveness.</p>
                  <p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diffuse the air that you are
                    working, living and sleeping in. &nbsp;If you are
                    suffering from symptoms, consider oils and blends
                    that will help. &nbsp;If you are trying to
                    quarantine areas of healthy air, diffuse on guard.</p>
