    <p><span class="label1">Sandalwood</span> is a name given to a class
      of fragrant woods that, unlike other aromatic woods, can retain
      their fragrance for decades.&nbsp; Both the wood and oil have been
      highly valued for centuries, and <span class="label1">sandalwood</span>
      has a documented history of many applications.&nbsp; It was
      traditionally used as an incense, in religious ceremonies, and for
      enhancing meditation; and the Egyptians used <span class="label1">sandalwood</span>
      for embalming. </p>
    <p>With a documented history of use going back several thousands of
      years, and with a wide variety of applications, <span

      users.&nbsp; It is most notable for its smoothing effects on skin
      and for its mood-enhancing properties. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="label1">Sandalwood</span> oils are steam distilled
        from the wood of the trees; <span class="label1">Indian
          sandalwood</span> from the <em class="noLink">Santalum album</em>
        tree and <span class="label1">Hawaiian sandalwood</span> from
        the <em class="noLink">Santalum paniculatum</em> tree.&nbsp;
        Both sources yield an oil with a sweet, woody aroma; but the <span
