Since the tendon is not as elastic as the muscle when there is a distorting injury it is the element that is most prone to tear and hence become inflamed.&nbsp; This can also happen when there is repeated stress to the tendon that causes microscopic tears that can become inflamed and painful over a period of time.&nbsp; These types of injuries are more prone to those 40 – 60 years old since their tendons are not as flexible as they were at a younger age.</p><p>Tendinitis can occur with any of the hundreds of tendons in the body but is most apt to occur in the tendons that we use the most, especially if we put repeated strain on them.&nbsp; Common areas of strain are elbows (tennis elbow), shoulders (swimmer’s shoulder), hips, wrists, knee (jumper’s knee), ankle, or heel.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/aromaTouch" class="button halfsize">Massage Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/basil" class="button halfsize">Basil</a>, Birch, <a href="#/tab/oils/cypress" class="button halfsize">Cypress</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/deepBlue" class="button halfsize">Soothing Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/helichrysum" class="button halfsize">Helichrysum</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemon" class="button halfsize">Lemon</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemongrass" class="button halfsize">Lemongrass</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/oregano" class="button halfsize">Oregano</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/peppermint" class="button halfsize">Peppermint</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/wintergreen" class="button halfsize">Wintergreen</a></p><p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/eucalyptusRadiata" class="button halfsize">Eucalyptus</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/marjoram" class="button halfsize">Marjoram</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/rosemary" class="button halfsize">Rosemary</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Apply oils topically to the area 2 or 3 times per day until pain is reduced.&nbsp; 2 -3 drops of Birch or Soothing Blend for inflammation and pain followed with Lemongrass for helping mend damaged tissue.&nbsp; Layering with Peppermint after a few minutes will help "drive" the oils deeper into the tissue.&nbsp; Or use a warm compress.&nbsp; Cypress will increase circulation and speed healing.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
