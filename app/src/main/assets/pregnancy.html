                  <p>Pregnancy is a wonderful period in life where a
                    great deal of personal time and energy is given to
                    one of God’s other children.&nbsp; A period where,
                    during times of relaxation, one can meditate and
                    communicate positive affirmations to the yet to be
                    born child.&nbsp; But!!! It is not as simple as that
                    may sound, it is also a time where tremendous
                    changes are going on in the body.&nbsp; Hormonal,
                    circulatory, structural, and emotional changes all
                    present a variety of physical and emotional
                    challenges that need to be addressed while the one
                    carrying the child is usually trying to carry on a
                    busy, “normal” life.&nbsp; Essential oils, blends,
                    supplements, and other products can help make this
                    whole period a lot easier.&nbsp; Read below and on

                  <h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3>
                  <h3>Back Pain</h3>
                  <p>With the added weight of the pregnancy and a new
                    and changing “center of gravity” your back will
                    experience extra strain so it is important to take
                    good care of it.&nbsp; Consider:</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Use normal good posture
                    techniques.</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight spine and
                    shoulders back when sitting or standing.</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Give up the high heels</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some recommend sleeping
                    on the left side and roll to the side when getting
                    up from a sleeping position.</p>
                  <p>Periodic massage with essential oils will help a
                    lot.&nbsp; Use those oils that would normally relax
                    your muscles and sooth your emotions.&nbsp; To relax
                    muscles consider Lavender or Marjoram and for you
                    emotions Frankincense, Lavender, or Ylang
                    Ylang.&nbsp; Many find the blends even more helpful,
                    Massage Blend, Soothing Blend to relax muscles and
                    Grounding Blend, Joyful Blend, Calming Blend or your
                    own favorites.</p>
                  <h3>Bleeding</h3>
                  <p>Bleeding during pregnancy can be serious and
                    seeking professional medical counsel is
                    advised.&nbsp; The first trimester of pregnancy is
                    when most miscarriages happen and bleeding usually
                    precedes them.&nbsp; On the other hand about fifty
                    percent of those experiencing early bleeding go on
                    to have successful births.&nbsp;</p>
                  <h3><strong>Breast, tender</strong></h3>
                  <p>During the months of pregnancy changes occur in the
                    breasts to prepare them for nursing. These changes
                    can be accompanied with tenderness or soreness.
                    Topical application of Geranium, Lavender and/or
                    Roman Chamomile either singly or in a blend with FCO
                    can help relieve that tenderness. Solace is a blend
                    that includes all of these oils and can be
                    considered.&nbsp;</p>
                  <h3><strong>Calming</strong></h3>
                  <p>The responsibility and associated stress of
                    pregnancy that some might feel sometimes needs the
                    help of the aromatic properties of essential
                    oils.&nbsp; The traditional oils and blends can
                    provide that with diffusing, cup and inhale or a few
                    drops in a warm bath. Consider any of the calming
                    oils such as Grounding Blend, Lavender,
                    Frankincense, Calming Blend or Ylang Ylang.</p>
                  <h3><strong>Constipation</strong></h3>
                  <p>Constipation, for some, accompanies
                    pregnancy.&nbsp; This highlights the importance of a
                    good diet that in our day and time must include
                    dietary supplements.&nbsp; As referenced elsewhere
                    the&nbsp; Life Long Vitality trio is an ideal set of
                    dietary supplements.&nbsp; Beyond this lots of fiber
                    should be in everyday meals along with lots of raw
                    fruits and vegetables.&nbsp; Also see Nutrition
                    below.</p>
                  <p>For those episodes where relief is needed from
                    constipation consider the oils Coriander, Ginger or
                    Peppermint or the Digestive Blend blend.&nbsp; 1-3
                    drops may be applied topically to the abdomen in
                    gentle circular motions moving up from the right
                    side or they can be taken internally by mixing 1-3
                    drops with water or a warm tea and teaspoon of honey
                    or with 1 to 3 drops in a capsule.</p>
                  <h3><strong>Edema (Swelling)</strong></h3>
                  <p>Edema (Oedema if you are British) is swelling in
                    any part of the body.&nbsp; During pregnancy,
                    especially in the third trimester, some swelling is
                    not unusual.&nbsp; This is typically in the feet and
                    legs but can be in the hands or face as well.&nbsp;
                    The cause of the swelling is the normal increase in
                    bodily fluids required by the body to sustain mom
                    and baby.&nbsp; Although some swelling is not out of
                    the ordinary it is complicated by the fact that
                    edema is also one of the early symptom of
                    pre-eclampsia (toxemia) that can be a very serious
                    condition.&nbsp;(See Toxemia below.)</p>
                  <p>To reduce normal swelling consider local massage,
                    especially on the feet and legs.&nbsp; Valerie
                    Worwood recommends using a blend of 3 drops Ginger,
                    2 drops Cypress, 2 drops Lavender added to 2
                    tablespoons of vegetable oil.&nbsp; Stephanie Fritz
                    adds to this blend Massage Blend and Lemon. The
                    local massage should always start with the feet (or
                    hands) and movements should always be towards the
                    heart.&nbsp;</p>
                  <h3><strong>Fatigue</strong></h3>
                  <p>The additional energy required to nourish and carry
                    the extra little one or ones along with the normal
                    responsibilities of life can deplete your energy
                    levels more rapidly than normal. Essential oils and
                    blends can provide a quick pickup of energy if
                    needed, relaxation to reset your energy levels reset
                    or long term help can come from nutritional
                    supplements.</p>
                  <p>Invigorating Blend or Joyful Blend blends or a home
                    made blend of equal parts Coriander, Grapefruit and
                    Lavender can be diffused, inhaled using cup and
                    inhale or added to FCO and used to massage neck and
                    shoulders. Mito2Max is a supplement for quick energy
                    and is recommended to be used with Professional
                    Medical advice during pregnancy. Also see Nutrition
                    below for long term energy levels.</p>
                  <h3><strong>Heartburn and Indigestion</strong></h3>
                  <p>An unfortunate companion to pregnancy for some are
                    various digestive ailments. 1 - 2 drops of
                    Invigorating Blend, Digestive Blend, Ginger or
                    Peppermint (different oils/blends work better for
                    some than others, also note the cautions below) can
                    be applied topically to the abdomen or taken
                    internally in a capule.</p>
                  <h3><strong>Hemorrhoids</strong></h3>
                  <p>Unfortunately pressure from constipation can result
                    in the uncomfortable condition of hemorrhoids.&nbsp;
                    Hemorrhoids have as a root cause the same elements
                    as varicose veins with the additional blood produced
                    by the body and downward pressure of the baby
                    putting additional pressure on the veins than then
                    might be weakened by the strain from
                    constipation.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>A blend of equal parts Geranium, Cypress and
                    Lavender or others have used a blend of Cypress and
                    Helichrysum very successfully.&nbsp; Topical
                    application, with a <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil or a salve like KG
                    jelly, to the affected area 2 or 3 times a day will
                    be helpful.</p>
                  <h3>Leg (muscle) Cramps</h3>
                  <p>Some experience muscle cramps as their bodies
                    adjust to the physical changes that come from
                    pregnancy. This can be exacerbated by nutritional
                    deficiencies (see Nutrition below). Topical
                    application of Massage Blend blend can provide
                    relief. Also a blend of 5 drops each of Cypress and
                    Geranium with 10 drops of Lavender in 1 ounce of FCO
                    has been used successfully.</p>
                  <h3><strong>Miscarriage, after</strong></h3>
                  <p>If a miscarriage occurs, care for Mom becomes even
                    more important emotionally and physically. Stephanie
                    Fritz recommends a blend of Clary Sage, Geranium and
                    Lavender for both emotional and physical needs.
                    Valerie Ann Worwood suggests a blend of 9 drops each
                    Frankincense and Roman Chamomile and 5 drops
                    Geranium.</p>
                  <h3><strong>Morning sickness</strong></h3>
                  <p>Even in a normal pregnancy morning sickness may be
                    one of the unwanted side effects.&nbsp; This nausea
                    normally occurs during the first trimester but on
                    occasion can extend into the second and even the
                    third (sorry).&nbsp; If morning sickness is
                    experienced it is because of the hormonal changes
                    occurring in the body which usually levels off as
                    the pregnancy progresses.&nbsp; There are a few
                    steps that can be taken that help many in reducing
                    the uncomfortable nausea.</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Get sufficient rest</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Get plenty of water (and
                    a drop of Lemon essential oil with each glass of
                    water will help)</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Small, multiple meals
                    (more protein at night, avoid fatty foods)</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Have good nutritional
                    supplements ( Life Long V<span>itality</span> trio
                    is a perfect supplement)</p>
                  <p>When nausea is eminent or occurs use essential
                    oils; Ginger, Peppermint, and the blend Digestive
                    Blend are all known for quieting an upset
                    stomach.&nbsp; Either topically rub the oils, with a
                    carrier, on your tummy, or take them internally (1 -
                    3 drops) in a capsule or sipped with water or juice.</p>
                  <h3><strong>Nutrition</strong></h3>
                  <p>The foundation for a healthy pregnancy is the Mom's
                    nutritional quality and balance. There are many
                    sources that describe in detail what these good
                    choices might be in terms of good proteins and
                    vegetables to ingest, what sugars and grains to
                    avoid and how to balance them. Most advise to have
                    plenty of water (3 - 4 quarts) each day and to
                    include a drop of Lemon with each glass of water.
                    Beyond this theLife Long Vitality supplements along
                    with the Bone Nutrient Lifetime Complex are
                    excellent ways to assure the daily nutritional
                    levels are met. If antibiotics are use following
                    with the PB Assist probiotics is an excellent idea.</p>
                  <h3><strong>Stretch Marks</strong></h3>
                  <p>Most women are susceptible to stretch marks as a
                    result of pregnancy, but with proper use of
                    essential oils there is no need for these
                    reminders.&nbsp; Stretch marks come in the obvious
                    places where excess fat resides or from the natural
                    enlargement from the baby.&nbsp; Start early, even
                    before the reddish-purple streaks appear,
                    moisturizing and healing the skin with an essential
                    oil ointment.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>DōTERRA makes a (anti-aging) moisturizing skin
                    lotion with Lavender, Jasmine, Geranium, and
                    Frankincense essential oils that is prepared and
                    ready to go as well as a Hand and Body Lotion plus
                    Anti-Aging Blend (Frankincense, Helichrysum,
                    Lavender, Myrrh, Rose, Sandalwood) an incredible
                    blend for the skin.&nbsp; Or, like many, mix your
                    own cream with the blend that suits you
                    perfectly.&nbsp; An important part of this cream
                    will be the base or <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil you use.&nbsp;
                    Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO) is excellent.&nbsp; Oils
                    for skin care include Lavender, Frankincense,
                    Helichrysum, and Geranium.</p>
                  <h3>Toxemia</h3>
                  <p>Pre-eclampsia occurs in the latter half of
                    pregnancy and includes high blood pressure
                    (headaches, dizziness, nausea), protein in the
                    urine, and edema (swelling in the feet and
                    legs).&nbsp; Cases may be mild or severe.&nbsp;
                    Serious cases pose dangers for mother and baby so if
                    more than mild symptoms occur professional medical
                    help should be consulted.</p>

                  <h3><strong>Varicose Veins</strong></h3>
                  <p>During pregnancy the weight of baby coupled with
                    the additional blood produced by the body puts
                    pressure on veins and arteries in lower
                    abdomen.&nbsp; This can cause varicose veins in the
                    legs where the veins become swollen and itchy.&nbsp;
                    Although not dangerous to the mom or baby that can
                    cause discomfort and be unsightly and unhealthy
                    longer term.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Here are some ways to help:</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not over exerting,
                    especially in lifting, would be a good precautionary
                    measure.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rest periodically with
                    the legs higher than the heart is another
                    help.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Couple with a massage
                    using an essential oils blend of 3 parts Geranium, 1
                    part Cypress mixed with a <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oils like VCO and
                    topically applied twice a day.&nbsp;Helichrysum
                    and/or Lavender are excellent additions to the
                    blend. The massage strokes should not apply a great
                    deal of pressure directly on the veins and should be
                    gentle strokes from the ankles to the thigh with the
                    motions always towards the heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <h3><strong>Cautions</strong></h3>
                  <p>"Be cautious about using essential oils during
                    pregnancy, especially during the first
                    trimester.&nbsp; Even oils that are generally safe
                    during this time may be too stimulating for women
                    who are prone to miscarriage.” (Aromatherapy, A
                    Complete Guide to the Healing Art, by Kathy Keville
                    &amp; Mandy Green).</p>
                  <p>The following partial list of essential oils gives
                    the prevailing wisdom in years past on how essential
                    oils may be used during pregnancy (please be aware
                    that some are very sensitive and may experience a
                    reaction to the mildest of oils and a skin test
                    should be used):&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Those oils ok to use:
                    Bergamot, Coriander, Frankincense, Geranium,
                    Grapefruit, Lavender, Lemon, Sandalwood, Wild
                    Orange, Ylang Ylang</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oils that for some would
                    be better used with a <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil or diluted in
                    other ways: Clove, Cypress, Eucalyptus, Ginger,
                    Helichrysum, Lemongrass, Marjoram, Melaleuca, Myrrh,
                    Oregano, Peppermint, Roman Chamomile.</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Consult a physician
                    before using these oils:&nbsp; Basil, Cassia,
                    Cinnamon bark, Clary Sage, Rosemary, Thyme, Vetiver,
                    Wintergreen, White Fir.</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally it is noted
                    that Peppermint used during the latter part of
                    pregnancy or after child birth can limit milk
                    production in some mothers.</p>
                  <p>Dr. David Hill said the following:</p>
                  <p>"You will find warnings everywhere about which oils
                    you should and should not use during pregnancy.
                    These previously were very valid concerns because of
                    the impurities that were so prevalent in the oils
                    available and the threat that they posed to a
                    developing fetus. But now that we enjoy the purity
                    of oils that we have with dōTERRA it is no longer an
                    issue"&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>He has also given these points of advice:</p>
                  <p>Stay away from Clary Sage if you were threatening
                    or had tendency to early labor.</p>
                  <p>Pay attention to your body on dosages as you may
                    need more oil because of increased weight or less
                    oil because your body was at a place of heightened
                    sensitivity.</p>
                  <p>Peppermint used during the latter part of pregnancy
                    or after childbirth can limit milk production in
                    some mothers.</p>
                  <p>Ylang Ylang with Clary Sage may be used during
                    childbirth and to stimulate uterine contractions.
                    Ylang Ylang is very powerful and only very small
                    amount are needed.</p>
