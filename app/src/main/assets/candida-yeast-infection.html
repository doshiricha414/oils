Most suggest taking the cleansing blend for two weeks on and then off for one week as you take a probiotic. Then repeat the cycle, as needed, until Candida symptoms are gone.&nbsp; Following this, for long term maintenance, continue with a good diet, exercise, and a monthly cleanse (2 weeks of the cleansing blend and 1 week of probiotics).</p><p>Avoid using antibiotics, birth control, and foods that are high in sugar or yeast as much as possible.</p><p>Often people complain of feeling badly or experience rash or other "die off" symptoms.&nbsp; It is not unusual to experience die off symptoms as your body purges the Candida.&nbsp;Consider a diet of raw foods during your cleanse, and drink LOTS of Lemon water.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/lemon" class="button halfsize">Lemon</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/teaTree" class="button halfsize">Melaleuca</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/oregano" class="button halfsize">Oregano</a></p><p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong>&nbsp; GX Assist, PB Assist</p><p><strong>Also consider: </strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/myrrh" class="button halfsize">Myrrh</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/onGuard" class="button halfsize">Protective Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/patchouli" class="button halfsize">Patchouli</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/rosemary" class="button halfsize">Rosemary</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/thyme" class="button halfsize">Thyme</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/zendocrine" class="button halfsize">Detoxification Blend</a></p><p> </p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Adults</p><p>Use the GX Assist/PB Assist protocol monthly (or more often to start with):&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1-3 GX Assist capsules daily with meals for 10 days</p><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow with the probiotic PB Assist for 5 days, 3 capsules per day</p><p> </p><p>The Candida Cleanse attributed to Dr. Hill that includes the following blend (This cleanse has now been streamlined into a premade blend called GXAssist described previously):</p><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 drops of Lemon</p><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 drops of Melaleuca</p><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 drops on Oregano</p><p>Put the oils into a gel cap and take internally twice a day for 10-14 days, rest two weeks and repeat the procedure.</p><p>Children 18 months to 5 years</p><p>Use the GX Assist/PB Assist protocol adapted in this way:</p><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Break open 1 GX Assist capsule and apply to the bottoms of the feet twice daily with morning and evening meals.
