                  <p>Gout, also know as gouty arthritis, is a painful
                    condition of the joints that results when there is
                    too much uric acid in the body.&nbsp; The excess of
                    uric acid leads to the formation of small crystals
                    of urate (uric acid crystals).&nbsp; Some of these
                    crystal deposits form in the synovial fluid
                    (lubricating fluid around joints) that then cause
                    inflammation and result in this painful condition.</p>
                  <p>The common gout attack is severe pain in the big
                    toe accompanied by redness and intense pain.&nbsp;
                    Other joints may be affected and the pain can be so
                    intense that even touching the area is
                    intolerable.&nbsp; Gout is most common among men and
                    postmenopausal women.&nbsp; Alcohol consumption,
                    high consumption of meats, being overweight, and
                    certain diuretic medications appear to increase the
                    risk of gout.</p>

                  <h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3>
                  <p>For immediate pain relief:</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; A few drops each of
                    Frankincense and Basil to the painful area.&nbsp;
                    After application cover with a hot towel
                    compress.&nbsp; Repeat 2-3 times daily.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Other oils combinations are
                    also recommended with the same procedure.&nbsp;
                    Lemongrass and Wintergreen or single oils Basil,
                    Soothing Blend, or Peppermint.</p>
                  <p>For long term prevention:</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 2 - 4 drops of Lemon in a
                    glass of water 2 - 3 times daily.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Consider cleanses especially
                    those that focus on the kidneys and other cleansing
                    organs.&nbsp; See Detoxification Blend.&nbsp; Also
                    consider the GX Assist cleanse followed with PB
                    Assist.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Life Long Vitality supplements
                    provide the balanced nutrition necessary.</p>
                  <p>Dietary considerations:</p>
                  <p><span>Many stress the importance of dietary
                      considerations.&nbsp; The following comes from
                      MayoClinic.com</span>:</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Limit animal protein. Avoid or
                    severely limit high-purine foods, including organ
                    meats, such as liver, and herring, anchovies and
                    mackerel. Red meat (beef, pork and lamb), fatty fish
                    and seafood (tuna, shrimp, lobster and scallops) are
                    associated with increased risk of gout. Because all
                    animal protein contains purines, limit your intake
                    to 4 to 6 ounces (113 to 170 grams) daily.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Eat more plant-based proteins.
                    You can increase your protein by including more
                    plant-based sources, such as beans and legumes. This
                    switch will also help you cut down on saturated
                    fats, which may indirectly contribute to obesity and
                    gout.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Limit or avoid alcohol.
                    Alcohol interferes with the elimination of uric acid
                    from your body. Drinking beer, in particular, has
                    been linked to gout attacks. If you're having an
                    attack, avoid alcohol. However, when you're not
                    having an attack, drinking one or two 5-ounce (148
                    milliliter) servings a day of wine is not likely to
                    increase your risk.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Drink plenty of fluids,
                    particularly water. Fluids can help remove uric acid
                    from your body. Aim for eight to 16 8-ounce (237
                    milliliter) glasses a day.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Choose low-fat or fat-free
                    dairy products. Some studies have shown that
                    drinking skim or low-fat milk and eating foods made
                    with them, such as yogurt, help reduce the risk of
                    gout. Aim for adequate dairy intake of 16 to 24
                    fluid ounces (473 to 710 milliliters) daily.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Choose complex carbohydrates.
                    Eat more whole grains and fruits and vegetables and
                    fewer refined carbohydrates, such as white bread,
                    cakes and candy.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Limit or avoid sugar. Too many
                    sweets can leave you with no room for plant-based
                    proteins and low-fat or fat-free dairy products —
                    the foods you need to avoid gout. Sugary foods also
                    tend to be high in calories, so they make it easier
                    to eat more than you're likely to burn off. Although
                    there's debate about whether sugar has a direct
                    effect on uric acid levels, sweets are definitely
                    linked to overweight and obesity.</p>
