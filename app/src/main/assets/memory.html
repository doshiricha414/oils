For the latter applied topically to the feet is effective or with a light massage action along the spine. Dr. David Hill also recommends applying the oils too in regions that are in close proximity to the sources of blood flow to the brain. Two he specifically mentions are on the areas of the right and left jugular just below the chin on the front and each side of the neck. The other is the suboccipital triangle which not only gives proximity to arterial flow to the brain but also key neurological tissue. He describes finding this by placing the fingers on the sub occipital protuberance (little bump at the top of the spine on the back of the neck) then just below this grip the large muscle tissue and roll the fingers off to the side. This depression just behind and below the ear is the suboccipital triangle and the location Dr. Hill suggests is an excellent place to topically applies these oils and blends.</p><p>Mental acuity is a combination of the ability to comprehend, concentrate, focus, and memorize.&nbsp; Many refer to this as the sharpness of the mind.&nbsp; It is not the same as IQ or intelligence that includes accumulated learning.&nbsp; Memory, or the ability to recollect things from the past, is itself a complex part of mental acuity.&nbsp; Each of these functions is associated with different parts of the most complex organ of the body, the brain.&nbsp; Memory is associated with the temporal lobes, thought is associated with the cortex and problem solving and judgment the frontal lobes.</p><p>Diet, essential oils and supplements (see Suggested Protocols tab above), and other activities can maintain and improve mental acuity. The following from the Harvard Medical School gives some basic hints on maintaining memory and mental acuity.</p><p>1. Keep learning</p><p>A higher level of education is associated with better mental functioning in old age. Experts think that advanced education may help keep memory strong by getting a person into the habit of being mentally active. Challenging your brain with mental exercise is believed to activate processes that help maintain individual brain cells and stimulate communication among them. Many people have jobs that keep them mentally active, but pursuing a hobby or learning a new skill can function the same way. Read; join a book group; play chess or bridge; write your life story; do crossword or jigsaw puzzles; take a class; pursue music or art; design a new garden layout. At work, propose or volunteer for a project that involves a skill you don’t usually use. Building and preserving brain connections is an ongoing process, so make lifelong learning a priority.</p><p>2. Use all your senses</p><p>The more senses you use in learning something, the more of your brain will be involved in retaining the memory. In one study, adults were shown a series of emotionally neutral images, each presented along with a smell. They were not asked to remember what they saw. Later, they were shown a set of images, this time without odors, and asked to indicate which they’d seen before. They had excellent recall for all odor-paired pictures, and especially for those associated with pleasant smells. Brain imaging indicated that the piriform cortex, the main odor-processing region of the brain, became active when people saw objects originally paired with odors, even though the smells were no longer present and the subjects hadn’t tried to remember them. So challenge all your senses as you venture into the unfamiliar. For example, try to guess the ingredients as you smell and taste a new restaurant dish. Give sculpting or ceramics a try, noticing the feel and smell of the materials you’re using.</p><p>3. Believe in yourself</p><p>Myths about aging can contribute to a failing memory. Middle-aged and older learners do worse on memory tasks when they’re exposed to negative stereotypes about aging and memory, and better when the messages are positive about memory preservation into old age. People who believe that they are not in control of their memory function are less likely to work at maintaining or improving their memory skills and therefore are more likely to experience cognitive decline. If you believe you can improve and you translate that belief into practice, you have a better chance of keeping your mind sharp.</p><p>4. Economize your brain use</p><p>If you don’t need to use mental energy remembering where you laid your keys or the time of your granddaughter’s birthday party, you’ll be better able to concentrate on learning and remembering new and important things. Take advantage of calendars and planners, maps, shopping lists, file folders, and address books to keep routine information accessible. Designate a place at home for your glasses, purse, keys, and other items you use often. Remove clutter from your office or home to minimize distractions, so you can focus on new information that you want to remember.</p><p>5. Repeat what you want to know</p><p>When you want to remember something you’ve just heard, read, or thought about, repeat it out loud or write it down. That way, you reinforce the memory or connection. For example, if you’ve just been told someone’s name, use it when you speak with him or her: “So, John, where did you meet Camille?” If you place one of your belongings somewhere other than its usual spot, tell yourself out loud what you’ve done. And don’t hesitate to ask for information to be repeated.</p><p>6. Space it out</p><p>Repetition is most potent as a learning tool when it’s properly timed. It’s best not to repeat something many times in a short period, as if you were cramming for an exam. Instead, re-study the essentials after increasingly longer periods of time — once an hour, then every few hours, then every day. Spacing out periods of study is particularly valuable when you are trying to master complicated information, such as the details of a new work assignment. Research shows that spaced rehearsal improves recall not only in healthy people but also in those with certain physically based cognitive problems, such as those associated with multiple sclerosis.</p><p>7. Make a mnemonic</p><p>This is a creative way to remember lists. Mnemonic devices can take the form of acronyms (such as RICE to remember first-aid advice for injured limbs: Rest, Ice, Compression, and Joyful Blend) or sentences (such as the classic “Every good boy does fine” to remember the musical notes E, G, B, D, and F on the lines of the treble clef).</p></div></div></div></div></div>
