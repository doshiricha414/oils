    <p>One of the most precious and sought-after of the essential oils,
      <span class="label1">helichrysum</span> has traditionally been
      used to help relieve tension, and to help the skin to recover
      quickly.&nbsp; It helps to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and
      other skin blemishes, and promotes a glowing, youthful complexion.
      But, it does so much more. </p>
    <p><span class="label1">Helichrysum</span> oil promotes healthy
      liver function, helping the body to detoxify.&nbsp; It promotes
      circulation and supports localized blood flow, making it a
      powerful tool in support of your overall health and wellness. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em class="noLink">Helichrysum italicum</em>, a flowering,
        plant of the daisy family <span class="noLink">Asteraceae</span>,
        is a small perennial herb, with narrow, silver leaves, and
        flowers that form a cluster of golden yellow, ball-shaped
        blossoms.&nbsp; The name "Helichrysum" is derived from the Greek
        "helios" meaning sun and "chrysos" meaning gold, referring to
        the color of the flowers. </p>
      <p><span class="label1">Helichrysum</span> oil we offer, is steam
        distilled from the flower cluster of the <em class="noLink">Helichrysum
          italicum</em> plant, yielding an oil with an herbaceous,
        honey, hay aroma.&nbsp; <span class="noLink"><em>Helichrysum
            italicum</em></span> is the most commonly distilled strain,
        because of its high concentration of aromatic constituents, as
        compared to other strains.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="label1">Helichrysum</span> has been used for its
        many health benefits since ancient Greece.&nbsp; It is best
        known for its ability to help the skin quickly recover, helping
        to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and other blemishes, while
        promoting a glowing, youthful complexion.&nbsp; It promotes
        healthy liver function, helping to detoxify the body.&nbsp; It
        also supports localized blood flow and promotes
        circulation.&nbsp; <span class="label1">Helichrysum</span> also
        helps to relieve tension. </p>
      <p><span class="label1">Helichrysum</span> oil contains active
        constituents that have not been identified in any other
        essential oil.&nbsp; These chemical constituents include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>up to 10% <span class="noLink">diketones</span>, </li>
        <li>up to 30% <span class="noLink">sesquiterpene hydrocarbons</span>,
          and </li>
        <li>up to 50% <span class="noLink">esters</span>. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Together, these create a powerful chemical profile, making it
        an ideal essential oil for many personal applications.&nbsp; It
        is a <em>wonderful</em> oil that is highly prized by essential
        oils users. </p>
      <p><em>Quality</em> <span class="label1">helichrysum</span> oil
        is quite rare.&nbsp; Because it is almost exclusively
        wild-crafted (due to the difficulty of maintaining active
        constituent levels in domestic strains), it tends to be hard to
        find.&nbsp; </p>
