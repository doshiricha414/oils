      Acid reflux and GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) are very
      closely related.&nbsp; Food we eat enters the stomach from the
      esophagus through a valve called the lower esophageal sphincter
      (LES).&nbsp; This valve, made up of muscles around the esophagus,
      may not close completely allowing acids (bile) and/or food to move
      back from the stomach into the esophagus.&nbsp; With that there
      may be a bitter taste, the taste of some foods, or a burning
      sensation in the chest (heart burn).&nbsp; If this progresses and
      happens frequently it has become GERD.

                  <p>The reasons for the lower esophageal sphincter to
                    not close properly may be mechanical.&nbsp; This can
                    happen with a hiatal hernia (part of the stomach
                    moves above the diaphragm), pregnancy, severe weight
                    gain, over eating, or lying down right after a
                    meal.&nbsp; Certain prescription medications
                    including sedatives, antidepressants, high blood
                    pressure, motion sickness, and asthma to mention a
                    few can bring on or worsen acid reflux.&nbsp;
                    Aspirin and ibuprofens can also contribute.&nbsp;
                    Diet can also be a factor.&nbsp; Items to avoid
                    include alcohol, carbonated drinks, coffee,
                    chocolate, garlic, onions, citrus, tomato, spicy,
                    fatty foods, or tobacco.</p>

                  <h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3>
                  <p>For adults:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Digestive Blend taken internally in a capsule,
                      add Ginger, Peppermint, or Wild Orange to
                      strengthen.</li>
                    <li>or ... Frankincense topically on the throat and
                      chest</li>
                    <li>or ... Lemon, 3 -5 drops in the back of the
                      mouth. Follow with water.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Note: some find Peppermint helpful but others find
                    it makes acid reflux worse.</p>
                  <p>For infants:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Digestive Blend rubbed on the feet, stomach, or
                      chest.&nbsp; (protect from the baby touching the
                      area and rubbing their eyes)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><br>
                    Pregnancy:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Maggie Tisserand, <em>Aromatherapy for Women</em>
                      speaks very highly of Sandalwood for heartburn
                      during pregnancy. Her personal use was taking one
                      drop internally. Our recommendation would be to
                      seek professional confirmation of such a self-help
                      procedure.</li>
