    <p> <span class="label1">Arborvitae</span> oil offers you powerful
      protection from both environmental and seasonal threats.&nbsp; It
      also has powerful cleansing and purifying properties, as well as
      promoting healthy cell function. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> <span class="label1">Arborvitae</span> essential oil is steam
        distilled from the wood of the <i class="noLink" lang="lt">Thuja
          plicata</i> tree.&nbsp; It has a warm, woody, earthy
        scent.&nbsp; It can be used aromatically or topically, and is
        safe to use without dilution (neat). </p>
      <p>Native to the Canadian Northwest, all parts of the <span
          class="label1">arborvitae</span> tree were used extensively by
        Native Americans for its health benefits, and for building
        vessels, totem poles, baskets and clothing.&nbsp; Because of its
        natural protective properties, <span class="label1">arborvitae</span>
        wood does not rot; which makes it popular in woodcraft and for
        preserving natural wood surfaces. </p>
      <p>Known, by some, as the "tree of life", <span class="label1">arborvitae</span>
        is majestic in size and, because of its high content of
        tropolones, the essential oil distilled from its wood is
        abundant in therapeutic benefits.&nbsp; Tropolones have a unique
        chemical structure, which makes them strongly bioactive. </p>
