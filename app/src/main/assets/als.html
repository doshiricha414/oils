                  <p>Lou Gehrig's disease or ALS affects nerve cells in
                    the brain and the spinal cord.&nbsp; The particular
                    nerve cells affected are the motor neuron cells that
                    control the voluntary muscles. The cause of ALS in
                    general is not known except for about 10 percent of
                    the cases where the cause can be traced to a genetic
                    defect.&nbsp; Symptoms do not usually develop until
                    a person is middle aged or beyond.&nbsp; It is more
                    common in men than women and is quite rare only
                    occurring in less than .002% (2 in 100,000) of the
                    population.&nbsp; The gradual progression of the
                    symptoms varies from individual to individual.&nbsp;
                    Some are only expected to live for a few years where
                    others may survive for decades.</p>
                  <p>Symptoms for those with ALS result from the motor
                    cells slowly deteriorating causing the person to
                    loose control of certain functions and making it
                    increasingly more difficult to perform ordinary
                    functions.&nbsp; This may begin with difficulty in
                    simple movements, breathing, and swallowing. With
                    time symptoms may progress to include difficulty
                    with speech, twitching, increasing muscle weakness
                    with more difficulty in movements, gagging or
                    drooling, and muscle cramps or paralysis.&nbsp;
                    Usually bladder and bowel functions are not affected
                    as well as eyesight, hearing, taste, touch, nor are
                    reasoning and cognitive functions typically
                    affected.</p>
