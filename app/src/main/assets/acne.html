                  <p>The outer layers of the skin include the pores and
                    the channels that house the hair follicles.&nbsp;
                    This channel also serves as the conduit from which
                    sebum and other lipids are secreted to lubricate the
                    skin and hair.&nbsp; The area of the hair follicle
                    also naturally includes some types of
                    bacteria.&nbsp; A number of different problems in
                    this area can result in acne or the other skin
                    blemishes that lead to acne.</p>
                  <p>The first step is the pore or channel of the hair
                    follicle becomes clogged.&nbsp; This may be caused
                    by an external source (dirt or products applied to
                    the skin) but more commonly is from excess sebum
                    being produced in combination with the naturally
                    occurring dead cells of the epidermis.&nbsp; The
                    lining of the channel housing the hair follicle is a
                    part of the epidermis that continually moves cells
                    from its inner layers to the surface where the dead
                    cells are discarded.&nbsp; These dead cells and the
                    sebum can then plug the pore and entrap bacteria in
                    the channel.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Smaller pores that are plugged are first seen as
                    whiteheads and the larger pores form
                    blackheads.&nbsp; If the bacteria cause an infection
                    these may become pimples.&nbsp; If the bacterial
                    infection continues the hair follicle channel can
                    rupture and the infection spread with the resulting
                    inflammatory response of the body forming larger
                    areas of irritation.</p>
                  <p>The reason for excess sebum or other clogging of
                    the hair follicle channels are varied.&nbsp; The
                    types of skin, that is heredity, is definitely a
                    factor.&nbsp; Other factors include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Hormonal levels (teenage years) and changes
                      related to menstrual cycle, pregnancy, or stress</li>
                    <li>Medications that may affect hormones such as
                      birth control, etc.</li>
                    <li>Cosmetics or hair care products</li>
                    <li>Excess moisture from perspiration or a high
                      humidity climate may compound the problem</li>
                    <li>Diet<br>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3>
                  <p><strong>Daily treatment: </strong>After cleansing
                    the skin put 3-5 drops of Fractionated Coconut Oil
                    in the palm of the hand with 3-4 drops of the
                    essential oil or blend. Pat this on the affected
                    area and let it soak in. Repeat this at night as
                    well.&nbsp; The oils found most effective are:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Cleansing Blend blend</li>
                    <li>Melaleuca</li>
                    <li>Geranium</li>
                    <li>Topical Blend blend (diluted)</li>
                    <li>Adding 1-2 drops of Lemon essential oil to a
                      glass of water (multiple times per day) is an
                      excellent natural cleanse.&nbsp;</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>The need to experiment -</strong> From the
                    experiences of others it is noted that different
                    folks will have more positive results with different
                    oils so it may be necessary to experiment to find
                    the best protocol.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><strong>Sensitive skin - </strong>Those with acne
                    often have sensitive skin so should consider the
                    following that cleanses like GX Assist and even the
                    Life Long Vitality supplements will help the body to
                    rid itself of toxins that are eliminated through the
                    skin.&nbsp; While it is good to rid the body of the
                    toxins they may cause further irritation to the skin
                    as they are eliminated.&nbsp; Therefore it may be
                    necessary to reduce the amount or frequency of these
                    types of products.</p>
                  <p><strong>Virgin Coconut Oil - </strong>There are
                    strong healing properties in Extra Virgin Coconut
                    Oil for the skin.&nbsp; It is recommended to use
                    this with the essential oils.</p>
                  <p><strong>Scarring -</strong> Topical application of
                    Helichrysum, Frankincense, or Rosemary will aid if
                    there is scarring to the skin.</p>
