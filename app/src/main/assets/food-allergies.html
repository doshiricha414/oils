One is a food intolerance the other is a food allergy. The confusing thing is that the symptoms are very similar.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Food intolerance.</strong> This is the body’s digestive system response to a disagreeable food. There are a variety of types of food intolerances the most common being lactose intolerance where an enzyme needed to fully digest milk products is missing in the body. Celiac disease (gluten intolerance) is when gluten, found in wheat and other grains, is harmful to the intestines. Other examples include reactions to chemicals or other additives added to some foods. Examples of this are color, flavor and preservative additives in many foods. Sulfites, for example, used in dried fruits, canned goods and wine can trigger asthma attacks. Beyond these food poisoning, digestive disorders or psychological factors can trigger reactions to foods in almost anyone.</p><p><strong>Food allergies.</strong> This is an immune system response to a disagreeable food. The body thinks that a protein in a particular food may be harmful and triggers an immune system response producing histamine to protect itself. The body “remembers” this and when this food enters the body again the histamine response is more easily triggered. The symptoms can vary depending on where the histamine is released in the body. If the histamine is released in the nose/throat area it will result in an itchy nose or respiratory problem. If released in the skin a rash may develop. Released in the digestive tract there can be stomach cramps, etc. Or there may well be a combination of these.</p><p>Symptoms that are similar in the two include digestive problems such as stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea or heartburn and to some degree headaches, migraines, rashes and classic allergy itchy nose, etc. Food allergies are more certain to cause skin reactions such as itching, rash or hives; respiratory reactions such as shortness of breath, chest pains or swelling in the airways or even a severe anaphylaxis reaction (throat/facial swelling, rash, low blood pressure).</p><p>Allergic reactions are quick, usually within 30 minutes and can be triggered by very small amounts of the allergen.&nbsp; On the other hand food intolerance reactions may be delayed by hours and are cumulative, that is, the more of the substance taken in the more severe the reaction can be.</p><p>Common foods that cause allergic reactions are fish, shellfish, tree nuts and peanuts plus children may have allergies to milk and eggs. Lactose (milk and milk products) intolerance and gluten intolerance are the most common of the food intolerances.</p><p> </p></div></div></div></div></div>
