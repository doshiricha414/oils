                  <p>Parkinson’s disease affects the smooth natural
                    movements of the body.&nbsp; The most common
                    evidences are tremors or shaking and walking
                    problems. This happens because the area of the brain
                    that controls these movements is not getting a
                    sufficient amount of dopamine, an important chemical
                    necessary for proper body movements.&nbsp; In those
                    with Parkinson’s, for some not yet fully known
                    reason, dopamine is not produced in sufficient
                    quantity.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>This is a condition that typically appears after
                    age 50 and is a common nervous system disorder among
                    the elderly.&nbsp; Rarely is it seen in children and
                    if so there usually seems to be some genetic link.
                    Parkinson’s may initially have only slightly
                    noticeable symptoms but it is a progressive disease
                    and symptoms will slowly become more evident over
                    the years. Presently there have not been found, in
                    the traditional scientific community, treatments
                    that halt the disease but there is help with
                    symptoms and help possibly slowing the
                    progression.&nbsp; Each of these provide hopeful
                    quality of life outcomes.</p>
                  <p>Early symptoms might include trembling in a hand or
                    arm, possible a limp or feeling a foot is not
                    lifting properly, and maybe a slight lack of
                    expression at times in the face.&nbsp; The person
                    may have a slower walk than normal and some
                    difficulty with balance.&nbsp; Advanced symptoms can
                    include increased trembling, difficulty in movement,
                    constipation, drooling, muscle pain and possibly
                    anxiety, depression, and dementia.</p>
                  <p>With respect to the early symptoms not everyone
                    with Parkinson’s shows the trembling symptom and not
                    all that have trembling symptoms have Parkinson’s.
                    Many with tremors or trembling with advanced age are
                    suffering from Essential Tremors and not
                    Parkinson's.</p>

                  <h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3>
                  <p>Here are some suggestions usingessential oils as
                    gleaned from a number of resources:</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; The Life Long Vitality
                    supplements will be of great benefit. (All the
                    literature recommends a healthy diet of nutritional
                    foods.)</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Apply oils periodically (at
                    least once per week) using the Massage Blend
                    Technique.&nbsp; This normally includes the oils
                    Grounding Blend, Lavender, Melaleuca, Protective
                    Blend, Massage Blend, Soothing Blend, Wild Orange
                    and Peppermint.&nbsp; Tamalu suggests complementing
                    these with Frankincense, Myrrh, and White Fir.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Use Frankincense at least
                    daily. 1 - 2 drops under the tongue, on spine, base
                    of skull, and crown of head.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; If there is agitation,
                    depression, or other such symptoms use relaxing oil,
                    etc. as suggested on other pages of this website.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; For some it may be important
                    to use cleanses as described elsewhere.&nbsp; The GX
                    Assist cleanse, Detoxification Blend <a href="#/tab/info/detoxification" class="button halfsize">detoxification</a> 
                    and/or others.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; A number suggest that if you
                    are "driving in" oils for neurological concerns that
                    you not use warm towels but rather something like
                    Peppermint oil.</p>
