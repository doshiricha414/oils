The more common locations are the nasal passages, the colon, the cervix and the urinary bladder. The growth may be attached directly to the mucous tissue or have a long connecting “stock”. Although some may be pre-cancerous or cancerous in most cases they are benign and not a serious health concern. They can cause related difficulties such as breathing problems with nasal polyps or unusual bleeding with cervical polyps.</p><p>Nasal polyps may be the most common and form in the nasal passages or sinus cavities. Those with asthma or allergies seem more likely to experience these. They vary in size and can cause difficulties in breathing or infections in the sinuses as they become large enough to block passages. They are very rarely malignant. Cervical polyps often times can go undetected. They seem to be more prevalent in those that have had several pregnancies. If there are symptoms they can include unusual bleeding or an unusual mucous like discharge if they become infected. Colon polyps, like others, may go undetected and in some instances they may become malignant although in most cases they are not a serious health concern.</p><p> </p></div></div></div></div></div>
