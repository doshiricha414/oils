Oils affect each of us differently. Therefore, it is good to experiment with those recommended to see which gives the most help.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most suggested are Grounding Blend, Tension Blend, Patchouli, Calming Blend, and Wild Orange.&nbsp; Suggested application techniques include:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Diffusion at home or in the office using a diffuser.&nbsp;</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Baths, 3 - 4 drops added to warm bath water.&nbsp; Mix well before entering.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Massage Blend technique.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Foot or hand massage with selected oil or blend.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; For those on-the-go.&nbsp; Use an inhaler with a selected oil or blend.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Also for those on-the-go.&nbsp; Use the Tension Blend roll on dispenser.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Also for those on-the-go use simple cup and inhale technique.</p><p> </p><p>Stress is the body’s normal reaction to abnormal situations either in the outside environment or internal physical or emotional changes.&nbsp; Stress is not always negative, sometimes external stressors require unusual responses and stress describes the body’s ability to make emergency changes.&nbsp; Scientifically a model used to describe stress includes 3 stages:&nbsp;</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Stage 1 – Alarm.&nbsp; When the stressor is first sensed the body will produce adrenaline (and other hormones) producing the fight-or-flight response.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Stage 2 - Resistance.&nbsp; If the stressor continues the body tries to adapt to the stressor.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Stage 3 – Exhaustion.&nbsp; As the body tries to adapt to the cause of the stress it may eventually not be able to cope with the demands placed on it.</p><p>The long term effects of Stage 3 can result in physical and emotional/mental disorders.&nbsp; Digestive system problems, ulcers, diabetes, cardiovascular problems, depression, sleeping disorders, and other emotional situations can all be related to stress.&nbsp; The various body systems call all be affected:</p><p><strong>Nervous System –</strong> The sympathetic nervous system signals the adrenal gland and adrenaline and cortisol are released (the fight-or-flight response).</p><p><strong>Cardiovascular System –</strong> Heart rate increases, there are stronger contractions of the heart, and blood vessels dilate allowing increased flow of blood to muscles.</p><p><strong>Endocrine System –</strong> The adrenal glands produce the increase adrenaline and cortisol.</p><p><strong>Gastro-intestinal System – </strong>Digestive processes are disrupted that may cause changes in eating habits, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting.</p><p><strong>Muscular System –</strong> Muscles tense that can result in cramping or over time result in&nbsp; headaches or other physical symptoms.</p><p><strong>Reproductive System –</strong> In men chronic stress can result in impotence as testosterone and sperm production are reduced.&nbsp; In women menstrual cycle changes can occur, sexual desires reduced.</p><p><strong>Respiratory System –</strong> Breathing can become rapid and/or hyperventilation can occur.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
