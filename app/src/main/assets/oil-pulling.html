                  <h3>What is Oil Pulling?</h3>
                  <p>Oil Pulling is a safe, simple, cheap and gentle
                    procedure who's benefits range from bringing health
                    to your mouth and ridding your mouth of harmful
                    toxins and bacteria, to a method that cures and
                    prevents diseases and extends your healthy life.<br>
                    <br>
                    Studies are on-going, but the procedure is gaining
                    more and more popularity as people are finding
                    success and positive results with <a href="#/tab/info/oil-pulling" class="button halfsize">oil pulling</a> &nbsp;
                    We will explain the details of <a href="#/tab/info/oil-pulling" class="button halfsize">oil pulling</a> later in
                    this article, but the basics involve pulling and
                    swishing 1 tablespoon of Coconut, Olive, Grapeseed
                    or some other quality oil around your mouth and
                    through your teeth for up to 20 Min., then
                    spitting.&nbsp; The therapy is simple and completely
                    harmless, as you do not ingest medication or drugs.<br>
                    <br>
                    Oil pulling was practiced in Ayurvedic medicine.
                    Modern <a href="#/tab/info/oil-pulling" class="button halfsize">oil pulling</a> was introduced in 1992 by Dr. F.
                    Karach, MD. Dr. Karach claimed that this treatment
                    will achieve remarkable results with illnesses like
                    migraine headaches, bronchitis, diseased teeth,
                    arterio thrombosis, chronic blood disorders such as
                    leukemia, arthritis and related illnesses,
                    neuro-physiological paralysis, eczema, gastro
                    enteritis, peritonitis, heart disease, kidney
                    disease, meningitis, and woman's hormonal disorders
                    are completely eliminated from the organism.&nbsp;
                    Dr. Karach's claims that <a href="#/tab/info/oil-pulling" class="button halfsize">oil pulling</a> heals the whole
                    body in perpetuity.&nbsp;&nbsp; He sites results
                    with terminal diseases such as cancer, aids and
                    chronic infections.<br>
                    <br>
                    According to the African Journal of Microbiology
                    Research, <a href="#/tab/info/oil-pulling" class="button halfsize">oil pulling</a> is an effective defense
                    against the bacteria associated with dental caries
                    (tooth decay). Studies show that it has also been
                    beneficial in the elimination of bleeding gums, the
                    fastening of loose teeth and the visible whitening
                    of the teeth.<br>
                    <br>
                    Many advocates of <a href="#/tab/info/oil-pulling" class="button halfsize">oil pulling</a> suggest safflower,
                    sunflower or vegetable oil, but more and more
                    studies and successes are finding higher quality
                    oils are more effective.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
                    anti-bacterial, anti-viral and anti-fungal
                    properties of whole, extra virgin coconut oil makes
                    it the perfect choice for <a href="#/tab/info/oil-pulling" class="button halfsize">oil pulling</a> and certainly
                    is gaining popularity.<br>
                    <br>
                    The use of essential oils added to the primary
                    pulling oil is slow to find it's way to most oil
                    pulling enthusiasts because of the lack of superior
                    essential oils that are certified therapeutic grade
                    quality.&nbsp;&nbsp; But as people discover how a
                    therapeutic grade essential oil can benefit oil
                    pulling, essential oils will become more and more
                    popular in <a href="#/tab/info/oil-pulling" class="button halfsize">oil pulling</a> </p>
                  <p>Does maintaining a healthy mouth help you have a
                    healthy body?</p>
                  <p>Up-and-coming science suggests that advanced gum
                    disease can be linked to diabetes, cardiovascular
                    problems, and pre-term birth.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Early stages of gum disease is gingivitis-which
                    affects a majority of all adults at some point in
                    their lives, and most don't even know it.<br>
                    <br>
                    Many theories exist and more studies are underway to
                    explore the connection between good oral health and
                    overall health. The conclusions lead us to know that
                    a healthy mouth leads only to good things.</p>
                  <p>Lets explore these connections more.</p>
                  <p>Persistent halitosis (bad breath) is often a sign
                    of a more serious problem in your mouth. Poor oral
                    hygiene and gum disease are the primary causes of
                    halitosis.<br>
                    <br>
                    It is estimated that around 50% of adults have some
                    form of gingivitis. Gingivitis, if left untreated,
                    may progress to a more serious condition called
                    periodontitis.<br>
                    <br>
                    Besides weakening your teeth to the point of loosing
                    them, studies suggest that periodontitis may affect
                    the health of your entire body. &nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    On going studies suggests that periodontitis may be
                    associated with diabetes, heart disease, and
                    numerous other health issues.</p>
                  <h3>Heart Disease and Heart Attack</h3>
                  <p>Studies suggest that advanced gum disease may be a
                    contributing factor to heart disease.&nbsp; The
                    theory is that gum disease or periodontitis, allow
                    oral germs to enter the bloodstream. These germs may
                    affect the heart by attaching to the fatty plaques
                    in your arteries, contributing to the formation of
                    clots. According to this theory, these clots, in
                    turn, can cause the restriction of blood flow
                    (a.k.a. atherosclerosis) which may lead to a heart
                    attack.</p>
                  <h3>Stroke</h3>
                  <p>On going studies also suggest that advanced gum
                    disease may be associated with the presence of
                    blocked arteries in the brain, a condition which may
                    lead to a stroke.<br>
                    <br>
                    Further studies advise that gum disease, if allowed
                    to progress, may allow germs to enter the
                    bloodstream. These germs may attach to the fatty
                    plaques in your arteries, contributing to the
                    formation of clots. According to this theory, these
                    clots, in turn, can cause the restriction of blood
                    flow and, in some cases, a stroke.</p>
                  <h3>Diabetes</h3>
                  <p>Emerging science also suggests that diabetes and
                    gum disease may be linked. Not only does diabetes
                    increase your chance of gum infection, but gum
                    infection may make diabetes harder to control.<br>
                    <br>
                    Diabetics are significantly more likely to develop
                    gum disease because of the way diabetes slows the
                    body's natural healing process. Research also
                    suggests that advanced gum disease may have an
                    adverse effect on blood-sugar levels-potentially
                    making diabetes treatment less effective.</p>
                  <h3>Can essential oils help with oral care, therefore
                    health care?</h3>
                  <p>This is where effective oral care can become a
                    necessary part of health care.&nbsp; Essential oils
                    used the with an oral care routine that includes
                    brushing, flossing and <a href="#/tab/info/oil-pulling" class="button halfsize">oil pulling</a> with anti-septic
                    and anti-bacterial essential oils can prevent
                    gingivitis and peridontitis, thus improving our over
                    all health care.</p>
                  <h3>Exactly how do you do it?</h3>
                  <p>Prior to breakfast on an empty stomach you take one
                    tablespoon of coconut or other <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil and add
                    3-6 drops of essential oils. &nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    Add your essential oils based on issues.&nbsp; They
                    might include, but are NOT limited to:</p>

                  <p>Take the oils into the mouth but do not swallow
                    it.&nbsp; Move the oil slowly in the mouth as
                    rinsing or swishing and as Dr Karach puts it; " sip,
                    suck and pull through the teeth" for fifteen to
                    twenty minutes.&nbsp; This process thoroughly mixes
                    the oils with saliva.&nbsp; Swishing activates the
                    enzymes and the enzymes draw toxins out of the
                    blood. The oil must not be swallowed, for it has
                    become toxic. As the process continues, the oil gets
                    thinner and white.&nbsp; It is then spit from the
                    mouth, the oral cavity must be thoroughly rinsed and
                    mouth must be washed thoroughly. Just use normal tap
                    water and brush with Protective Blend toothpaste.<br>
                    <br>
                    This has in effect pulled toxins and poisons out
                    through the mucous membranes of the mouth to be
                    expelled.&nbsp; If you use virgin coconut oil, expel
                    into the garbage, as it can solidify in the drain.<br>
                    <br>
                    It is important to understand that during the
                    <a href="#/tab/info/oil-pulling" class="button halfsize">oil pulling</a> swishing process one's metabolism is
                    intensified. Many feel this leads to improved
                    health.&nbsp; For many, the most striking results of
                    this process is the fastening of loose teeth, the
                    healing of sores, the elimination of bleeding gums
                    and the visible whitening of the teeth.<br>
                    <br>
                    The <a href="#/tab/info/oil-pulling" class="button halfsize">oil pulling</a> /swishing is done best before
                    breakfast. To accelerate the healing process, it can
                    be repeated three times a day, but it is always best
                    before meals on an empty stomach.<br>
                    <br>
                    Remember, do not swallow. The oil should be spat
                    out.<br>
                    <br>
                    Per Dr. Karach, that this treatment will achieve
                    remarkable results with illnesses like migraine
                    headaches, bronchitis, diseased teeth, arterio
                    thrombosis, chronic blood disorders such as
                    leukemia, arthritis and related illnesses, neuro
                    physiological paralysis, eczema, gastro enteritis,
                    peritonitis, heart disease, kidney disease,
                    meningitis, and women's hormonal disorders are
                    completely eliminated from the organism. The benefit
                    according to Dr. Karach's is that the oil therapy
                    heals the whole body in perpetuity. In terminal
                    diseases such as cancer, aids and chronic infections
                    Dr. Karach reports this treatment method has been
                    shown to achieve astonishing results.</p>
