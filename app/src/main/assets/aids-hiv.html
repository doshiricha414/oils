                  <p>AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the
                    final stage of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)
                    disease, which causes severe damage to the immune
                    system.&nbsp;&nbsp; This limits the body’s ability
                    to protect itself against other bacteria, fungus,
                    parasites, and viruses that otherwise would not be a
                    concern.&nbsp; If the HIV infection occurs there may
                    be no symptoms for even years but the infection can
                    still be transmitted during this period.&nbsp; Most
                    that acquire the virus will eventually show
                    symptoms, have acute HIV, and finally develop AIDS
                    if they are not treated.&nbsp; A small percentage
                    that acquire HIV will not progress to AIDS and this
                    seems to be based on genetics.</p>
                  <p>The HIV is transmitted primarily by bodily fluids
                    during any type of sexual contact. &nbsp;It may also
                    be transmitted by contact with the blood of an
                    infected person (including shared needles) or from
                    mother to child during pregnancy and breast
                    feeding.&nbsp; The common symptoms of AIDS include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><span></span>Chills</li>
                    <li><span></span>Fevers</li>
                    <li><span></span>Sweats (particularly at night)</li>
                    <li><span></span>Swollen lymph glands</li>
                    <li><span></span>Weakness</li>
                    <li><span></span>Weight loss</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>AIDS is a pandemic in the world today and it is
                    estimated that over 30 million people in the world
                    are infected.&nbsp; In the United States it was the
                    number one killer of young adults and by 2009 this
                    has been reduced to number six.</p>
                  <p>A protocol (HAART) is used with some success to
                    limit the virus.&nbsp; This uses a combination of
                    several antiretroviral&nbsp;drugs and is quite
                    complex and expensive.&nbsp; Wikipedia gives this
                    explanation of this type of antiviral drugs.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Antiviral drugs are often
                    nucleoside analogues, which are molecules very
                    similar, but not identical to DNA building blocks.
                    When the replication of virus DNA begins, some of
                    these fake building blocks are incorporated. As soon
                    as that happens, replication stops prematurely—the
                    fake building blocks lack the essential features
                    that allow the addition of further building blocks.
                    Thus, DNA production is halted, and the virus can no
                    longer reproduce … Other antiviral drugs target
                    different stages of the viral life cycle. HIV is
                    dependent on an enzyme called the HIV-1 protease for
                    the virus to become infectious. There is a class of
                    drugs called protease inhibitors, which bind to this
                    enzyme and stop it from functioning. ,,, HIV
                    infections are usually treated with a combination of
                    antiviral drugs, each targeting a different stage in
                    the virus's life-cycle. There are drugs that prevent
                    the virus from attaching to cells, others that are
                    nucleoside analogues and some poison the virus's
                    enzymes that it needs to reproduce.</p>
                  <p>Wikipedia also gives this information on
                    alternative therapy:</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Naturally
                      occurring antiretrovirals</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    A variety of natural compounds have been proposed as
                    treatments for HIV-infection. Among these compounds
                    are the spice cumin, the fat AL 721, Chinese
                    cucumber, the herb St John’s wort, the minerals
                    selenium and zinc, beta-carotene (found in carrots),
                    vitamin E, and mushrooms. No natural compounds have
                    ever been shown to inhibit HIV replication in human
                    test subjects.</p>

                  <h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3>
                  <p>Although the literature indicates that, to date, no
                    antiviral agents have been found that will defeat
                    the HIV there are a number of ways to consider that
                    essential oils may help. A suggested protocol is a
                    drop of Melissa and Protective Blend daily on the
                    roof of the mouth combined with a healthy diet,
                    exercise, and the LLV supplements for strength.<em>
