The area can vary widely in size from pinpoint size to large areas and can involve multiple patches. The irritation can quickly disappear from one spot and appear in another. Many times hives are an allergic response to a food, drug or some agent that triggers a histamine reaction. Other causes noted are some infections, stress and then in many cases the cause cannot be pinpointed.</p><p>Angioedema is a form of hives where, instead of being on the surface of the skin, the swelling is beneath the skin. This can be around the eyes, lips, genitals, hands or feet.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/basil" class="button halfsize">Basil</a>, GX Assist/PB Assist, <a href="#/tab/oils/myrrh" class="button halfsize">Myrrh</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/peppermint" class="button halfsize">Peppermint</a></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/coriander" class="button halfsize">Coriander</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/helichrysum" class="button halfsize">Helichrysum</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemon" class="button halfsize">Lemon</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/teaTree" class="button halfsize">Melaleuca</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Since hives may be associated with the elimination of internal toxins many suggest <a href="#/tab/info/detoxification" class="button halfsize">detoxification</a> using the GX Assist/PB Assist protocol; GX Assist for 10 days, PB Assist for 5 days, once a month.</p><p>Topical application of Basil or Myrrh to the affected area is suggested.</p><p>The following protocol for difficult hives was submitted:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Alternate topical application of Helichrysum and Melaleuca with Frankincense to the affected area.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; First day begin at 2 hour intervals, second day 3-4 hour intervals, follow 3-4 times per day till two days after hives are gone.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Additional help by applying the same oils along the spine.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
