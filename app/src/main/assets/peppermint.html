    <p><span class="label1">Peppermint</span> is one of the oldest - and
      most highly regarded - herbs, and has been used for thousands of
      years.&nbsp; It is popular in countless forms, frequently used in
      toothpaste and chewing gum, for oral health.&nbsp; <span
        class="label1">Peppermint</span> also helps to alleviate
      occasional stomach discomfort and promotes healthy respiratory
      function and clear breathing. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The <em class="noLink">Mentha piperita</em> plant is actually
        a hybrid of watermint and spearmint, and was first described by
        Carl Linneaus, in 1753. </p>
      <p><span class="label1">Peppermint oil</span> was used by the
        ancient Egyptians and Romans, as well as many other groups,
        throughout history.&nbsp; Today, it is very widely used in
        foods, candies, gums, dental products and cosmetics.&nbsp; In
        fact, it may well be one of the most readily recognizable scents
        and flavors. </p>
      <p>The oil is distilled from the whole <em class="noLink">Mentha
          piperita</em> plant, and yields an oil with a minty, hot,
        herbaceous aroma, high in chemical compound <span
          class="noLink">menthol</span>.&nbsp; This high <span
          class="noLink">menthol</span> content, found in this <span
          class="label1">peppermint</span> essential oil, distinguishes
        the best quality <span class="label1">peppermint</span> from
        other products. </p>
      <p>There are more than 30 different compounds in pure <span
          class="label1">peppermint oil</span>, each in varying amounts,
        creating a synergistic <em>masterpiece</em> of biological
        activity. </p>
