                    of bacterial, viral, fungal or protozoa type
                    infections of the skin.</p>

                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; To relieve itching - Lavender</p>

                    Geranium, Frankincense, Helichrysum and Myrrh</p>

                  <p>For candida or internal conditions - GX Assist/PB
                    Assist, Detoxification Blend or Lemon with water.</p>
                  <p>Some ointments suggested by others include:</p>
                  <p>Ointment 1:</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    1 teaspoon carrier such as Extra Virgin Coconut Oil</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;20 drops Lavender</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    20 drops Geranium</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    20 drops Melaleuca</p>
                  <p>Ointment 2:</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    1 teaspoon carrier such as Extra Virgin Coconut Oil</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    10 drops Lavender</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    5 drops Helichrysum</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    5 drops Myrrh</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    3 drops Melaleuca (if there is topical infection)</p>
                  <p>Use the ointments for direct topical application to
                    the affected area.</p>
                  <p>For larger areas use a bath adding the 6 to 12
                    drops of the Lavender and the other oils as needed.</p>
                  <p>Finally, understand that skin condition problem's
                    root cause is many times an internal infection and
                    the skin irritation is only a manifestation of an
                    internal candida problem.&nbsp; Therefore, strongly
                    consider using a cleanse like the GX Assist/PB
                    Assist or the Detoxification Blend nutritional
                    cleanse .&nbsp; Couple this with the Life Long
                    Vitality supplements to balance nutrition.&nbsp; In
                    some reported cases of prolonged eczema the GX
                    Assist had to be repeated multiple times.</p>
                  <p>Dermatitis and eczema are general terms for types
                    of inflammation of the skin, whereas psoriasis is a
                    more specific disease that results in similar
                    inflammation. They all produce red, inflamed skin
                    and the terms overlap and are sometimes confused.
                    Medically to distinguish psoriasis from the other
                    conditions will take elaborate testing. Here are
                    some of the general characteristics of each.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Dermatitis is caused either by an irritant or by an
                    allergic reaction to something that comes in contact
                    with the skin. An irritant can come from excessive
                    contact with something like a soap or other cleaning
                    agent, a chemical used in employment or even
                    different types of hair or hygiene products.&nbsp;
                    An allergic reaction is different in that the
                    contact with the allergen may only be casual and
                    then the rash may appear 24 to 48 hours after
                    contact. Allergens mentioned are things like nickel
                    used in jewelry, dyes, adhesives, medications,
                    preservatives, etc. The primary symptom is red
                    itching skin in the area of contact.</p>
                  <p>Eczema, a type of dermatitis (most common form is
                    atopic dermatitis) is believed to be the result of a
                    genetic defect although the exact cause is not
                    known. The rash is normally triggered by contact
                    with some form of irritant or allergen. It is more
                    common in infants and young children. The rash is
                    characterized by red itchy skin but is not usually
                    as “flaky” as psoriasis.</p>
                  <p>Psoriasis typically occurs in adults and is a life
                    long condition. Some suggest it is an autoimmune
                    disease. It is a result of internal conditions in
                    the body rather than from contact with an irritant
                    or allergen although it may be triggered by skin
                    irritations or even weather conditions or emotional
                    or physical stress. Because of imbalance in the body
                    excess skin is produced so the red inflamed skin
                    includes silvery white scales that flake off. These
                    spots may become sore and burning.</p>
                  <p>With any of these conditions open lesions from
                    cracking and itching can lead to secondary
                    infections complicating the situation.&nbsp;
                    Finally, understand that skin irritations many times
                    are triggered by toxins being eliminated from the
                    body. So a common candida outbreak internally may
                    well trigger an eczema or a psoriasis condition.</p>
