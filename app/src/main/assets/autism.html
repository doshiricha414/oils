                  <h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3>
                  <p><strong>Note -</strong> Since many with ADD/ADHD,
                    asperser's, or autism are highly sensitive to odors
                    and sometime touch do not force the application of
                    oils if it is a negative experience as this will
                    build a experiential resentment towards their use in
                    the future. Many times it is successful letting them
                    make their own selection from a few choices of oils.</p>
                  <p><strong>Focus - </strong>Vetiver (Frankincense,
                    etc) oil carried with the child during the day can
                    help them if they find themselves loosing focus or
                    calm.&nbsp; Clay necklaces with the preferred oil or
                    applying some oil to the area of the hand between
                    the thumb and first finger allows an easy quick
                    technique to inhale during a busy school day.</p>
                  <p><strong>Special Blend</strong> - Focus Blend is a
                    special blend&nbsp;(Amyris, Frankincense, Lime,
                    Patchouli, Roman Chamomile, Sandalwood, Ylang Ylang)
                    prepared to enhance focus and support healthy
                    thought processes. &nbsp;</p>
                  <p><strong>Rest - </strong>Many times lack of rest
                    and relaxation is an issue and nightly foot massages
                    with Lavender or other relaxing oils is very
                    helpful.&nbsp; Also consider diffusing relaxing
                    blends or oils.</p>
                  <p><strong>Diet -</strong> Be assured nutritional
                    balance is addressed.&nbsp; Using the Life Long
                    Vitality supplements (reduced quantities depending
                    on age) and testing for and eliminating any food
                    allergies is important.</p>
                  <p><strong>Application - </strong>These oils and
                    blend can be inhaled or carried via the blood
                    stream. For the latter applied topically to the feet
                    is effective or with a light massage action along
                    the spine. Dr. David Hill also recommends applying
                    the oils to in regions that are in close proximity
                    to the sources of blood flow to the brain. Two he
                    specifically mentions are on the areas of the right
                    and left jugular just below the chin on the front
                    and each side of the neck. The other is the
                    suboccipital triangle which not only gives proximity
                    to arterial flow to the brain but also key
                    neurological tissue. He describes finding this by
                    placing the fingers on the sub occipital
                    protuberance (little bump at the top of the spine on
                    the back of the neck) then just below this grip the
                    large muscle tissue and roll the fingers off to the
                    side. This depression just behind and below the ear
                    is the suboccipital triangle and the location Dr.
                    Hill suggests is an excellent place to topically
                    applies these oils and blends.</p>
                  <p>More on protocols:</p>
                  <p>The early writers on the use of essential oils
                    (Valnet, Tisserand, Gassefosse) were before our
                    modern era where this type of disorder has become so
                    common.&nbsp; For that reason there is no
                    information from them on the use of oils.&nbsp; More
                    recent essential oils users have documented their
                    successes in using oils to address the symptoms
                    often experienced by those with autism.&nbsp; <br>
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><span></span>For frustration, impatience, and
                      anger use oils and blends that calm.&nbsp;
                      Grounding Blend, Calming Blend, Lavender, Ylang
                      Ylang.&nbsp; Applying to the feet, back of the
                      neck, behind the knees, and diffusion are all
                      suggested.</li>
                    <li><span></span>For improved concentration the oil
                      Vetiver.&nbsp; Again on the feet or, for school
                      children that need help during the school day, a
                      necklace with a pendant that will absorb the oil
                      can make it available all day.</li>
                    <li><span></span>Some, with autism, are particularly
                      sensitive to smell and may resist the use of
                      oils.&nbsp; Applying to the feet, even after they
                      are asleep, can circumvent this problem.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Autism is a developmental disorder that affects the
                    way a child communicates and interacts.&nbsp; It can
                    be generalized as ASD (autism spectrum disorder)
                    that includes a range of different manifestations
                    that varying in degree of severity.&nbsp; ASD
                    includes Asperger’s syndrome (high-functioning
                    autism), autism, and PDD-NOS (pervasive
                    developmental disorders-not otherwise specified).</p>
                  <p>From the National Institute of Neurological
                    Disorders and Stroke:&nbsp; “Autism spectrum
                    disorder (ASD) is a range of complex
                    neurodevelopment disorders, characterized by social
                    impairments, communication difficulties, and
                    restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of
                    behavior.&nbsp; Autistic disorder, sometimes called
                    autism or classical ASD, is the most severe form of
                    ASD, while other conditions along the spectrum
                    include a milder form known as Asperger syndrome,
                    the rare condition called Rett syndrome, and
                    childhood disintegrative disorder and pervasive
                    developmental disorder not otherwise specified
                    (usually referred to as PDD-NOS).&nbsp; Although ASD
                    varies significantly in character and severity, it
                    occurs in all ethnic and socioeconomic groups and
                    affects every age group.&nbsp; Experts estimate that
                    three to six children out of every 1,000 will have
                    ASD.&nbsp; Males are four times more likely to have
                    ASD than females.”</p>
                  <p>This article goes on to describe some of the signs
                    of autism in this way, impaired social interaction,
                    children may fail to respond to their names, they
                    often avoid eye contact with other people, they have
                    difficulty interpreting what others are thinking or
                    feeling because they can’t understand social cues,
                    such as tone of voice or facial expressions, and
                    don’t watch other people’s faces for clues about
                    appropriate behavior.&nbsp; They lack empathy. Many
                    engage in repetitive movements such as rocking and
                    twirling, or in self-abusive behavior such as biting
                    or head-banging.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>They also tend to start speaking later than other
                    children and may refer to themselves by name instead
                    of “I” or “me.”&nbsp; Children with ASD don’t know
                    how to play interactively with other children.&nbsp;
                    Some speak in a sing-song voice about a narrow range
                    of favorite topics, with little regard for the
                    interests of the person to whom they are speaking.
                    Another characteristic of autistic children is they
                    are very sensory sensitive.&nbsp; This could be hot
                    or cold, touch, taste, or smell.&nbsp; This is
                    important with essential oils since some may not be
                    able to have oils applied directly but may need them
                    applied to the feet or with diffusion where they do
                    not have such a strong sensory impact.</p>
