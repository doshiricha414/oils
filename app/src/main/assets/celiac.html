Celiac disease is genetic and can develop at any age in life from infancy to adulthood.&nbsp; What occurs is as foods with gluten are eaten the body produces antibodies to attack the gluten but these antibodies then mistakenly attack the lining of the small intestines.&nbsp; This damage to the intestinal lining includes the villi that are responsible to absorb nutrients and begin their delivery to other body systems.&nbsp; The nutrients particularly affected are fats, calcium, iron, and folate (folic acid or vitamin B9).&nbsp;</p><p>With deficiency in these nutrients a number of symptoms emerge that vary from individual to individual with the disease.&nbsp; These symptoms include:</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Abdominal pain and bloating</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Indigestion, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty stools (pale, large, bad odor, floating)</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Decreased (or increased) appetite</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lactose intolerance</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Weight loss, growth problems in children</p><p>Some symptoms are not associated with the digestive system:</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dermatitis herpetiformis (a skin rash)</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Anemia (iron deficiency), fatigue</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Missed menstrual periods</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Muscle cramps, joint and bone pain</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sores in mouth</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Seizures</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Easily bruising, nose bleeds</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dental discoloration, hair loss</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nutrient deficiencies, malnutrition</p><p>Beyond physical symptoms depression, irritability, and behavioral changes can accompany the difficulties in diagnosing and dealing with this disease.</p><p>3 Problems with similar symptoms</p><p>IBS (irritated bowel syndrome), IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), and celiac disease.&nbsp; What is the difference?</p><p>All three conditions can have similar symptoms hence sometimes leading to confusion.&nbsp; Further complicating this is the fact that IBS is very common, occurring in as many as twenty percent of Americans while IBD and Celiac are less frequent.&nbsp; Therefore, since the symptoms may be similar, there is often a quick diagnostic conclusion of the more common IBS.&nbsp; Here is a summary of differences:</p><p><strong>IBS – Irritable bowel syndrome</strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technically this is a disorder rather than a disease because the bowels are not damaged.&nbsp; Some believe that nerves that control the contractions of the bowels that move food through the intestinal tract send incorrect signals to the colon or rectum.&nbsp; These contractions, that are normally regular, may then increase in frequency or become spasmodic leading to the symptoms often experienced.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Symptoms may include chronic constipation, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort or pain.&nbsp; It can be triggered by stress, insufficient fluids, inadequate nutrition, allergic reaction to certain foods, or just not eating properly (gulping a meal down, eating on the run, etc.).</p><p><span>IBD – Inflammatory bowel disease</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This term refers to a number of different diseases of the bowels.&nbsp; They are typically chronic conditions with inflammation of different areas of the intestine and may cause eventual damage.&nbsp; Often they are associated with or are themselves autoimmune in nature.&nbsp; The two most common forms are ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Symptoms may include diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, bloody stools, and/or a fullness and pain in the lower right abdomen.&nbsp; Blood tests will show unique markers that are not present in IBD.</p><p><strong>Celiac disease</strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Celiac disease is genetic and an autoimmune disease wherein the body mistakenly attacks the gluten protein found in grains.&nbsp; As with IBD and unlike IBS, this is a disease that causes damage to the intestinal system.&nbsp; With celiac the damage is done to the lining of the small intestines but IBD can be anywhere in the intestinal tract.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence with a bad odor, fatty stools (pale, large, bad odor, floating), weight loss and others.&nbsp; Celiac has been reported to be triggered by trauma after surgery, childbirth, stress, and even viral infection.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
