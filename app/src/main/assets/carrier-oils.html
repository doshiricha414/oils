One example is when applying to the skin.&nbsp; Powerful, highly concentrated essential oils may cause skin irritations.&nbsp; Another use for <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oils blended with essential oils is that they are often applied during massage, acting as a needed lubricating agent when working larger areas and muscles.&nbsp;</p><p>One advantage of <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oils is that they do not evaporate like essential oils that tend to evaporate quicker when applied neat.&nbsp; Carrier oils actually aid in absorption.</p><p>Incorporate <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oils for massaging, making lotions, rubs, and creams for use on babies, children, elderly, and sensitive areas.</p><p>Below are some common <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oils:</p><h3><br />Coconut Oil</h3><p>Whole coconut oil is solid at room temperature and has long unsaturated fatty acid triglycerides.&nbsp; This oil has a high percentage of completely saturated triglycerides (no double bonds).&nbsp; When the smaller fatty acids and long-chain triglycerides are separated from the whole coconut oil, it leaves only saturated fats or a fraction of the whole oil.&nbsp; This is then known as "Fractionated Coconut Oil."</p><h3><strong>Advantages of Fractionated Coconut Oil</strong></h3><p>With no double bonds, there is no oxidation.&nbsp; Thus, fractionated coconut oil is a carrier that never goes rancid.&nbsp; It basically has an indefinite shelf life and is in a perfectly clear liquid form. Other advantages of fractionated coconut oil are:</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is odorless and colorless.&nbsp; It won’t stain and easily washes out of clothing and sheets.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It absorbs into the skin while reducing essential oil evaporation.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is excellent on skin; a natural and very safe moisturizer, softener and safe, non-irritant lubricator.&nbsp;</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It leaves skins smooth with no greasy feeling.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Low production costs make it cost effective.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be mixed with other, more expensive, carriers to increase shelf life.&nbsp; It can also be used it to create different cream textures.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not aggravate skin problems or clog pores.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fully digestible and considered an excellent and healthy cooking oil.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is truly one of the best multi-purpose <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil products on the market.</p><h3><strong>Advantages of Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO - not fractionated)</strong></h3><p>DoTerra's coconut oil is a great product with a great shelf life and is liquid at room temperature but it does not include all the fat chains. VCO on the other hand has its own advantages and some real followers that are adamant about its health and wellness attributes. A little internet research and you'll see the passion out there. I have personally seen it do amazing things by itself, especially in the area of skin care, but when you blend VCO with doTerra essential oils you create a synergizing product that I believe is far superior that just either product alone.</p><p>An example. &nbsp;We had a friend who had a son with a rash under his eye. Likely herpes. We had him apply some essential oils, which seemed to slowly be helping, but when we combined the oils with VCO, the irritation was completely gone in a few short days.</p><p>You get organic VCO at the health food store or on line. &nbsp;It's white, solid (below about 73 degrees) and has a slight coconut flavor. &nbsp;If you melt it to add essential oils, don't use a microwave but place a glass container with the VCO in a pan with hot water from the tap. This will be sufficient warmth to melt the VCO. (thanks for the hint, Denise) &nbsp;Then you add the oils and blend a salve and save it in a baby food jar or other small jar.</p><p> </p><h3>Grapeseed Oil&nbsp;</h3><p>Obviously from its name, grapeseed oil is made from the seed of the grape.&nbsp; Its production prior to the 20th century was limited because grape seeds contain such a small quantity of oil.&nbsp; The process of extraction therefore is labor intensive.&nbsp; It is most widely known for its healthy culinary applications.&nbsp; It is beginning to be recognized as a massage oil, lotion base, hygiene cream, and lip balm.&nbsp; It is relatively odorless and is an excellent <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil.&nbsp; It is mostly clear with a very light yellow/green tinge and has a slightly sweet taste.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other advantages of grapeseed oil are:</strong></p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It offers regenerative and restructuring characteristics that offer quality skin moisturizing.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is considered an excellent lubricant for massage and shaving.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It leaves a glossy film that protects essential oils from evaporation.&nbsp; Saturation takes longer than some other carriers.&nbsp;</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some claim it has astringent qualities that tighten and tone the skin.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not aggravate acne or clog pores.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Jojoba Oil</h3><p>Jojoba oil is found in the seed of the Jojoba plant.&nbsp; The oil makes up nearly 50% of the seed in weight.&nbsp; It is native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.&nbsp; It is considered a natural wax.&nbsp; It is nearly colorless (slight yellow tint) and odorless.&nbsp; It is normally liquid at room temperature; its melting point is just over 40° F.</p><p><strong>Other advantages of jojoba oil are:</strong></p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a very stable shelf life and when mixed with other carriers, increases their shelf life.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is known for its nourishing qualities for the skin.&nbsp;</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It closely resembles the natural oils of our own skin</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It absorbs well into the skin, with no greasy feeling.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is naturally protective to sensitive skin.</p><p> </p><h3>Olive Oil</h3><p>Olive oil is universally known a one of the most quality culinary oils. It has a multitude of uses however, including a quality <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil.&nbsp; Depending on the press, it has a full-bodied flavor and a strong aroma, and can also have a golden brown or green color.&nbsp; If it is a color and odor that is pleasing then enjoy its healthful benefits to the skin and hair.</p><p><strong>Other advantages of olive oil:</strong></p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a high vitamin and mineral count.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a quality lubricant.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It has approximately a one-year shelf life.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an excellent conditioner for hair.</p><p> </p><h3>Safflower Oil</h3><p>Safflower oil is extracted from the seeds of the safflower plant grown in great abundance for this commonly used vegetable oil and is relatively inexpensive.&nbsp; It has a high content of unsaturated fatty acids and can go rancid quickly.&nbsp; Its best shelf life (about 1 year) is guaranteed if it is mixed with another quality <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil such as fractionated coconut oil.&nbsp; It is a pale yellow, nearly colorless, and has very little odor.</p><p><strong>Other advantages of safflower oil:</strong></p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It has excellent moisturizing qualities.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a good lubricant.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easily absorbed.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Quality safflower does not stain.</p><p> </p><h3>Dilution</h3><p>Essential oils can be added to <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oils or a <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil can be applied first to an area, followed by an essential oil, this process is referred to as dilution.&nbsp; It is usually specified in terms of either a percentage or a number of drops to be added to an amount of <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil.&nbsp; The descriptions in the chapters on Wellness Uses and Health Concerns often give either the number of drops or percentage.&nbsp; The chart below helps to convert from percentage to the number of drops of essential oils required.&nbsp; Over time, it will feel comfortable deciding the amount of carrier to use for certain applications.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div></div>
