Essential oils neat (undiluted) will also not likely irritate the tough skin of the foot and will still enter the body.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp; Most users will not react to quality, pure oils and they can be safely applied for a direct powerful effect. Melaleuca or Lavender oils are very mild even for more sensitive skin and can be effectively used undiluted on burns, insect bites, pimples, and other skin eruptions.&nbsp; Essential oils are very powerful and are very efficacious even when they are applied with a carrier.&nbsp; Carriers are often used during massage to help lubricate larger areas.</p><p>The following are basic<br />precautions for using essential oils:</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Some Essential Oils Are Photosensitive. </strong>&nbsp;Some oils are photosensitive meaning they react to radiant energy or light such as natural sunlight, sunlamps, or other sources of UV rays.&nbsp; An adverse response appears within minutes, hours, or days after first application and exposure.&nbsp; These oils are primarily citrus oils and include angelica, Bergamot, Grapefruit, Lemon, Lime, Orange, Wild Orange, and tangerine.&nbsp; The result is a dark pigmentation or a rash on the skin.&nbsp; Bergamot contains bergaptene, a dominant photosensitizer, and can cause severe reactions. When using photosensitizing oil, wait a minimum of six hours before exposing skin to UV rays.&nbsp; The stronger and more lengthy the UV ray, the longer the wait should be.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Use Care with Babies and People with Sensitive Skin. </strong>&nbsp;Quite frankly, some people just have sensitive skin.&nbsp; Common sense should be used.&nbsp; Increased watchfulness should be used when treating babies, young children, and the elderly.&nbsp; Their skin is much more sensitive and susceptible to irritation, burning, or stinging sensations. &nbsp;Using an effective <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil will protect sensitive skin against irritation.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Use Care with Eyes, Ears, etc.</strong>&nbsp; Never apply oils directly to the eyes or ear canal.&nbsp; After application, be attentive to things like rubbing the eyes, areas around the eye, eyelids, handling contact lenses, or touching the interior of one’s nose.&nbsp; The skin is most sensitive and prone to irritation around the genitals and mucous membranes.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Use care when applying oils to infants and children. </strong>&nbsp;After application the child should be supervised and areas where oils were applied should be clothed until the oils have been sufficiently absorbed to protect from cross contamination.&nbsp; A baby might easily grab their foot after oils were applied and then rub his or her eyes.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Pregnancy.&nbsp; </strong>Aromatherapists generally agree that no oils topically (externally) applied at ordinary amounts have ever proven harmful to a developing fetus.&nbsp; However, pregnant women might want to consult a physician or licensed aromatherapist prior to using essential oils.&nbsp; If there are specific oils that pregnant women should be concerned about, it will be noted on the oil bottle from most reputable suppliers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathi Keville summarizes it best “Be cautious about using essential oils during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. Even oils that are generally safe during this time may be too stimulating for women who are prone to miscarriage.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See the chart at the following for specific recommendations.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Critical Health Conditions.&nbsp; </strong> Persons with asthma, epilepsy, high blood pressure, or other critical health conditions can benefit from essential oils, but should consult a healthcare or aromatherapy professional when addressing these serious conditions. See the chart at the end of this chapter for specific recommendations.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Oils Not Suitable for Use in Aromatherapy.&nbsp; </strong>Caution or consultation should be used before using wormwood, pennyroyal, camphor, sassafras, onion, bitter almond, and horseradish.&nbsp; Ruta gravenolens or rue essential oil is classified as poisonous to humans and should not be used.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A Little Goes a Long Way.&nbsp; </strong>There is a reason for the drip hole in top of oil bottles.&nbsp; All essential oils are pure concentrates.&nbsp; The higher quality the oil the more potent it is and smaller amounts are required.&nbsp; A little goes a long way.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>GRAS.&nbsp; </strong>Most essential oils are safe for ingesting.&nbsp; The oils section of this book will note if an oil is GRAS, generally regarded as safe by the FDA.&nbsp;&nbsp; If ingesting these powerful essences, consider diluting it in a water, agave, honey, or juice.&nbsp; These methods are especially appropriate for younger children.&nbsp; Some application techniques will direct you to oils which can be ingested without dilution.&nbsp; A number of essential oils are used in cooking.&nbsp; If there is a question of GRAS, consult a qualified aromatherapist.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Keep Out of Reach of Children.&nbsp; </strong> Treat essential oils the same as medicine.&nbsp; Oils can be painful or harmful if used in the eyes or if large quantities of the wrong oil are ingested.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Essential Oil and Bath Water.&nbsp; </strong> One common application method is use of a bath.&nbsp; Full body, foot or hand baths are all common.&nbsp; When using undiluted oil in bath water, agitate the mixture because the oil can pool as a concentrated drop in one spot in the water.&nbsp; You can also use a dispersing gel.&nbsp; Oils will evaporate very quickly in hot water.&nbsp; If you want to enjoy a hot bath, Start it hot, then add the oils and agitate the water after the temperature has gone down.</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Many Oils Are Flammable.&nbsp; </strong>Keep them clear of open flame, spark, or Fire hazards.</p><p> </p><p>Summary</p><p>On the chart following is a summary of information gleaned from respected authors regarding the characteristics of most common oils (Please be aware that some are very sensitive and may experience a reaction to the mildest of oils and a skin test (see above) should be used).</p></div></div></div></div></div>
