    <p><span class="label1">Thyme</span>, familiar to most as a common
      seasoning for cooking, produces and essential oil that has
      valuable cleansing and purifying properties.&nbsp; It is also
      notable for its broad-spectrum activity for winter health. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em class="noLink">Thymus vulgaris</em> (common <span
          class="noLink">thyme</span>) is a flowering plant in the <span
          class="noLink">Lamiaceae</span> (mint) family.&nbsp; It is
        native to southern Europe, from the western Mediterranean to
        southern Italy. </p>
      <p><em class="noLink">Thymus vulgaris</em>is a generally upright,
        bushy, woody-based perennial, primarily grown as a culinary herb
        in herb gardens.&nbsp; Growing from ½ to 1 foot tall, and about
        the same in width, its stems are clothed with tiny, linear to
        elliptic, pointed, gray-green leaves which are distinctively <a
          title="Leaf margins are rolled under.">revolute</a>, with
        small, highly aromatic, grey-green leaves and, in early summer,
        clusters of showy purple or pink flowers. </p>
      <p>The leaves of the <em class="noLink">Thymus vulgaris</em> are
        frequently used — fresh or dried — as a seasoning in a variety
        of culinary applications, including soups, stews, sauces, meat
        and fish dishes. </p>
      <p>Thought to impart courage to its bearer, ladies of the Middle
        Ages would give <span class="label1">thyme</span> to knights
        and warriors, before they went into battle.&nbsp; During this
        same period, it was often placed beneath pillows, to help
        promote a peaceful sleep and to ward off nightmares.&nbsp; The
        ancient Greeks used <span class="label1">thyme</span> in their
        baths, and burned it as an incense in their temples, while the
        Egyptians used it in their embalming rites. </p>
      <p><span class="label1">Thyme</span> oil is steam distilled from
        the leaves of the <em class="noLink">Thymus vulgaris</em>
        plant, yielding an oil with a warm, herbaceous, floral, powdery
        aroma, high in the chemical compound of <span class="noLink">thymol</span>.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><span class="label1">Thyme</span> oil, like the fresh or dried
        herb, is excellent in cooking; but the oil also provides
        cleansing and clarifying effects for the skin; however, due to
        its high phenol content, <span class="label1">thyme</span>
        should <em>always</em> be diluted with&nbsp; carrier oil,&nbsp;
        before application. </p>
      <p><span class="label1">Thyme</span> oil is composed of specific
        chemical compounds that produce broad-spectrum activity, in
        promoting winter-time health.&nbsp; Including thyme essential
        oil in food dishes, or consuming one to two drops a day, will
        promote a healthy immune system, when seasonal threats are high.</p>
