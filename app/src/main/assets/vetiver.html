    <p><span class="label1">Vetiver</span> oil is loved for its rich,
      exotic and complex aroma.&nbsp; Used extensively in perfumes, as a
      base note and fixative, <span class="label1">vetiver</span>'s
      woody, earthy scent complements many other essential oils. <span
        class="label1">Vetiver</span> also has many therapeutic uses,
      including supporting healthy circulation, calming, grounding the
      emotions and enhancing the immune system. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em class="noLink">Vetiveria zizanoides</em>, a member of the
        grass (<span class="noLink">Gramineae</span>) family.&nbsp; It
        is grown for many reasons.&nbsp; Unlike other grasses, the root
        system of the <em class="noLink">Vetiveria zizanoides</em>
        plant grows down deep, making it ideal for helping to prevent
        erosion and providing soil stabilization. </p>
      <p><span class="label1">Vetiver</span> oil is extracted through a
        process called hydro diffusion of the roots of the <em
          class="noLink">Vetiveria zizanoides</em> plant, yielding an
        oil with a sweet, woody, caramel, smoky aroma, high in the
        chemical compound class of <span class="noLink">terpenes</span>.
      </p>
      <p>Hydro diffusion is a type of steam distillation, varying from
        other steam distillation methods only in the way in which the
        steam is introduced into the still. </p>
      <p>With what we normally think of as steam distillation, steam is
        introduced from <em>below</em> the botanical material, with the
        oil-containing steam mixture rising up and condensing down
        through tubing into a collection vessel. </p>
      <p>However, with hydro diffusion, the botanical material is held
        in place by a grill, and the steam is fed in from the top, onto
        the botanical material, with the condensation of the
        oil-containing steam mixture occurring below.&nbsp; The main
        advantage of this method is that less steam is used, shorter
        processing time and a higher oil yield. </p>
      <p><span class="label1">Vetiver</span> oil has a rich, exotic,
        complex aroma.&nbsp; Due to its calming, grounding effect on the
        emotions, and its ability to promote healthy circulation, <span
          class="label1">vetiver</span> is an ideal oil to use in
        massage therapy.&nbsp; It can also be rubbed on the feet before
        bedtime to promote a restful night's sleep. </p>
      <p>When taken internally, <span class="label1">vetiver</span>
        acts as an overall tonic to the body's systems while promoting
        immunity and overall health. </p>

      <p><span class="label1">A tip on using vetiver oil:</span> You can
        use a toothpick to help get the desired amount out of container,
        if <span class="label1">vetiver</span> is too thick to get out
        of the bottle.&nbsp; There is no reason to feel frustrated if
        you can't get much oil out, in this manner; a little <span
          class="label1">vetiver</span> goes a long way. </p>
      <h3>How to use </h3>
      <p><span class="label1">Vetiver</span> oil is intended for
        aromatic, topical or dietary use.&nbsp; It is gentle enough to
        be used neat. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="label1">Diffusion:</span> Use three to four
          drops in the diffuser of your choice. </li>
        <li><span class="label1">Internal use:</span> Dilute one drop in
          4 fl oz of liquid. </li>
        <li><span class="label1">Topical use:</span> Apply one to two
          drops to desired area. While gentle enough to be used neat,
          dilution with fractionated coconut oil will help to minimize
          any possible skin sensitivity. See additional precautions
          below. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="label1">Cautions:</span> Possible skin
        sensitivity.&nbsp; Keep out of reach of children.&nbsp; If you
        are pregnant, nursing, or under a doctor's care, consult your
        physician.&nbsp; Avoid contact with eyes, inner ears and
        sensitive areas. </p>
