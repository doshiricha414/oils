In popular usage, it refers to drugs used to treat cancer or the combination of these drugs into a formulation for specific types of cancer.</p><p>Most commonly, chemotherapy acts by killing cells that divide rapidly, as that is one of the main properties of cancer cells. This means that it also harms cells that divide rapidly under normal circumstances: cells in the bone marrow, digestive tract and hair follicles.&nbsp; This results in the most common side effects of chemotherapy - decreased production of blood cells, inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract, and hair loss.</p><p>Under the procedures tab others share their experiences in how essential oils, blends, and other products help strengthen the body during this process.&nbsp; This include rebuilding blood cells, restoring digestive functions, and helping with depression and fear during a very invasive process.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong></p><p><strong>Depression and anxiety: </strong><a href="#/tab/oils/balance" class="button halfsize">Grounding Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/serenity" class="button halfsize">Calming Blend</a></p><p><strong>Immune system strength:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/cypress" class="button halfsize">Cypress</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/onGuard" class="button halfsize">Protective Blend</a>.&nbsp; Also <a href="#/tab/info/massage-blend-technique" class="button halfsize">Massage Blend Technique</a>.</p><p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong> <strong>Nutrition:</strong> Life Long Vitality supplements.</p><p><strong>Also consider: </strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/citrusBliss" class="button halfsize">Invigorating Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemon" class="button halfsize">Lemon</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Depression and anxiety:&nbsp; Diffuse the oils of choice.&nbsp; Daily Massage Blend&nbsp; technique is beneficial at multiple levels and calms with the oils and human touch.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
