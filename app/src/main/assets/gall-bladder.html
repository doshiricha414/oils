This blockage results in irritation and the gall bladder may become swollen. Physical injury in an accident or occasionally an infection can result in this inflammation.</p><p>The gallbladder itself is under the liver and is located on the front right side just below the rib cage. The liver, gall bladder and pancreas help in the digestive process by producing and storing bile and digestive enzymes. Bile assists in digesting fats and high cholesterol foods. It is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder from where it is injected into the small intestines through the common bile duct as needed.</p><p>Symptoms of an inflamed gall bladder may include nausea, vomiting, or pain in the right side of the abdomen, back, or just under the arm.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/digestZen" class="button halfsize">Digestive Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemon" class="button halfsize">Lemon</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/onGuard" class="button halfsize">Protective Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/peppermint" class="button halfsize">Peppermint</a></p><p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong> PB Assist, ZDC, <a href="#/tab/oils/zendocrine" class="button halfsize">Detoxification Blend</a></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/geranium" class="button halfsize">Geranium</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/helichrysum" class="button halfsize">Helichrysum</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, Rose, <a href="#/tab/oils/rosemary" class="button halfsize">Rosemary</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Discomfort and pain<span> (this is also reported to help those that have had their gall bladder removed and experience digestive discomfort) </span>:</p><p>Digestive Blend and Peppermint may be applied topically or taken in a capsule internally.
