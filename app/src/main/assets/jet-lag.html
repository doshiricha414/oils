Bodies have a natural 24 hour rhythm highly influenced by the daylight and night darkness that includes a rhythm in body temperature, hormones and other bodily functions. With travel at jet speeds we disrupt these rhythms and find ourselves listless and without energy when we would like to be alert or energized and unable to sleep at a time we know we should be rejuvenating.</p><p>Different strategies of adaptation are suggested depending on the length of time one is to be in the new time zone. If only for 1 or 2 days then it is suggested not to try to fully adapt but plan activities well and use naps and stimulation to bridge the differences. 3 to 5 days is the most difficult for most since it does not allow time to fully adapt but schedules and activities probably require being alert and sleeping per the new time zone. Finally for periods beyond this then finding a strategy to adapt as quickly as possible is recommended.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/elevation" class="button halfsize">Joyful Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/geranium" class="button halfsize">Geranium</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/inTune" class="button halfsize">Focus Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/peppermint" class="button halfsize">Peppermint</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/rosemary" class="button halfsize">Rosemary</a></p><p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong> Life Long Vitality supplements</p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/balance" class="button halfsize">Grounding Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/eucalyptusRadiata" class="button halfsize">Eucalyptus</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/grapefruit" class="button halfsize">Grapefruit</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemongrass" class="button halfsize">Lemongrass</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Healthy nutrition and hydrations: Long Life Vitality and Lemon or Grapefruit in your water, avoid alcohol, coffee and other artificial stimulants.</p><p>Relax: Grounding Blend or Lavender to avoid travel fear or meeting stress.</p><p>Sleep at the right time: Lavender or Geranium under the nose, diffuse or in baths to encourage sleep.</p><p>Be alert at the right time: Peppermint for alertness, Joyful Blend for energy, Focus Blend or Vetiver for focus.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
