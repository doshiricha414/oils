It is common with aging occurring in 50 % of those over 75 and 33% of those between 65 and 75. Symptoms can include:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Not hearing the higher frequencies in sound such as being able to hear male voices easier than female or missing the s or th sounds in conversation.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Having trouble understanding when there is considerable background noise</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Hearing but not understanding certain words</p><p>There are a number of common causes for loss of hearing.</p><p>Conductive hearing loss (CHL) occurs when there are problems with the ear drum or the tiny bones that conduct sound in the ear. These can be damaged or interfered with by wax buildup, fluids that remain during and after an infection or injury from something inserted into the ear.</p><p>Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) as the nerve endings in the ear that sense sound are not responding correctly. Age-related hearing loss is usually attributed to this. It can also be the result of some diseases (Meniere’s, mumps, measles), exposure to loud noises and a side effect of some medicines.</p><p>Congenital hearing loss are problems present at birth and can be genetic or due to certain infections during pregnancy.</p><p>Injury can be the cause such as extreme pressure differences during diving, a direct blow or trauma to the ear or other injuries.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/balance" class="button halfsize">Grounding Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/eucalyptusRadiata" class="button halfsize">Eucalyptus</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/geranium" class="button halfsize">Geranium</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/helichrysum" class="button halfsize">Helichrysum</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/serenity" class="button halfsize">Calming Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/whiteFir" class="button halfsize">White Fir</a></p><p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/fennel" class="button halfsize">Fennel</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Application technique: With each application apply the oils by dripping them into the palm of the receiving person and the applying person dipping their fingers in the oil and with a rubbing/massaging motion start at the front of the ear, then over the fleshy rim of the ear and down to the ear lobe multiple times.
