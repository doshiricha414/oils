                        reversing the damage to lungs is not instantly
                        possible help can be provided from essential
                        oils by opening the air passages to the lungs
                        thereby increasing the oxygen available.
                        &nbsp;Most direct of these techniques is using
                        the&nbsp; Respiratory Blend or a similar blend
                        of essential oils. &nbsp;Respiratory Blend
                        includes the oils Eucalyptus, Laurel leaf,
                        Lemon, Melaleuca, Peppermint, and Ravensara. </span></span></p>
                  <p><span><span style="font-size:15px">Aromatically
                        applying this blend is most commonly
                        recommended. &nbsp;Some simply apply 2 or 3
                        drops nightly to their upper lip, just under the
                        nostrils, so it may be inhaled during the
                        sleeping hours. &nbsp;For instant results others
                        have used the cup and inhale technique.
                        &nbsp;Here 1 or 2 drops are placed in the palm
                        of the hand, the hands are rubbed together and
                        then held over the nose while the aroma is
                        inhaled deeply. &nbsp;Another technique is to
                        use a diffuser where the blend can be diffused
                        in the atmosphere for long-term inhalation.
                        &nbsp;Other oils can be used or blended if
                        Respiratory Blend is not available. &nbsp;Look
                        primarily to those oils mentioned above blended
                        to your special needs or preference.</span></span></p>

                        with topical application of 1 or 2 drops of the
                        blend to the chest and trachea area or the
                        bottoms of the feet provides added effect for
                        many.</span></span></p>
