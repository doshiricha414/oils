                  <p>Angina is a symptom not a disease.&nbsp; It is a
                    symptom of the heart not receiving enough oxygen
                    which in turn causes the chest pains termed angina.
                    The pain is noted as a tightness or pressure in the
                    chest.&nbsp; Some with severe angina describe it as
                    a severe or very heavy pressure on the
                    chest.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two common and one
                    unusual type of angina.&nbsp;</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><span></span> Chronic angina – this occurs with
                      physical activity or other times (stress, high
                      altitude, over eating, even smoking) when the
                      heart is working harder than normal.&nbsp; This
                      usually lasts a short time (5 minutes) and may
                      subside with rest.&nbsp; Essential oils can help
                      relieve the discomfort and shorten the duration of
                      such occurrences.</li>
                    <li><span></span> Unstable angina – This condition
                      requires medical attention since there is an
                      immediate risk of a heart attack.&nbsp; When the
                      symptoms described above occur with no physical
                      activity or other reason why the heart should be
                      working harder than normal then proper precautions
                      for a heart attack should be followed.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><span></span>Variant angina – This is rare
                      symptom that comes on without warning and is
                      caused by a coronary artery spasm or tightening.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Any of these symptoms are exacerbated by CHD
                    (Coronary Heart Disease) where plaque, caused by fat
                    and cholesterol, builds up in the artery limiting
                    the oxygen being taken to the heart muscles.</p>

                  <h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3>
                  <p>Apply Grounding Blend and Wintergreen topically
                    (dilute with a carrier for those with sensitive
                    skin) directly to the heart area and/or <a href="#/tab/info/reflexology" class="button halfsize">reflexology</a> 
                    points on the feet or hands. Alternate with
                    Peppermint or Ginger. Inhalation using cup and
                    inhale or diffusing may also be considered.</p>
                  <p>Editorial note: <em>Just as a reminder when angina
                      symptoms occur with no physical activity or other
                      reason why the heart should be working harder than
                      normal then proper precautions for a heart attack
                      should be followed. The common protocol if you are
                      experiencing symptoms of a heart attack is to 1)
                      take two aspirin, 2) call 911, 3) call someone
                      close by to be with you, 4) sit (don't lie down)
                      and 5) wait for help to arrive.&nbsp; [if aspirin
                      is not available Wintergreen topically over heart
                      gives similar benefits]</em></p>
