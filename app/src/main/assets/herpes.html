There are two strains. Type I usually breaks out around the mouth and is commonly called a cold sore or a fever blister. Type II is called genital herpes and erupts in the genitalia area. Both are highly contagious and both can occur in either area of the body.&nbsp; The sores are contagious at any time but especially when the blisters that form erupt and fluids seep out.&nbsp; It is important to cleanse the hands after treating these areas since the fluids can be transmitted to other parts of the body.&nbsp; Two more probable secondary infections are herpetic whitlow, an infection of the fingers, and&nbsp; ocular herpes, an infection of the eye that damages the cornea.</p><p>Canker sores in the mouth are not related to HIV I.&nbsp; For insight into the difference between cold sores and canker sores go to the tab on Science &amp; Research above.</p><p>An example of how both types of herpes lie dormant until our immune system is weakened is the common occurrence of cold sores when one suffers from a cold or is in a tense situation. This emphasizes that one good defense against an outbreak is to keep our immune system strong and to strengthen ourselves emotionally. If an outbreak is caught very early it can be limited.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/clove" class="button halfsize">Clove</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/geranium" class="button halfsize">Geranium</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/teaTree" class="button halfsize">Melaleuca</a>,&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/melissa" class="button halfsize">Melissa</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemongrass" class="button halfsize">Lemongrass</a>,&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/peppermint" class="button halfsize">Peppermint</a></p><p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/aromaTouch" class="button halfsize">Massage Blend</a> Massage</p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/bergamot" class="button halfsize">Bergamot</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/eucalyptusRadiata" class="button halfsize">Eucalyptus</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemon" class="button halfsize">Lemon</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/myrrh" class="button halfsize">Myrrh</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/sandalwood" class="button halfsize">Sandalwood</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/thyme" class="button halfsize">Thyme</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/purify" class="button halfsize">Cleansing Blend</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p><strong>Topical -</strong> Apply one or two drops neat (undiluted) to the outbreak area as often as every 2 hours and not less than 3 times per day.&nbsp; Continue for 3 days after symptoms are gone.&nbsp; Melissa and Lemongrass are highly recommended, Melaleuca and Peppermint are suggested oils.&nbsp; Lavender, Myrrh, or a blend of Frankincense and Sandalwood can also be used. Some find Melissa irritating to the skin and advise always diluting with a <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil. For any of the oils use at least a 50/50 dilution when applying to a sensitive area and increased dilution for children or those with sensitive skin.</p><p><strong>Internal -</strong> Additional protection can be achieved by adding 1-2 drops of Melissa&nbsp; or other antiviral oils or blends to a capsule and taking 3 times per day.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Additional help - </strong>Herpes outbreaks typically occur when the body's immune system is weakened or at times of emotional stress.&nbsp; Strengthening the immune system and emotions is important to minimize outbreaks.&nbsp; The <a href="#/tab/info/massage-blend-technique" class="button halfsize">Massage Blend Technique</a> and reducing toxins with cleanses like GX Assist and Detoxification Blend plus PB Assist will provide long term strength.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Special Precautions: </strong>Do a skin test with the oil(s) to be used. When applying oils keep hands away from other areas where viral infection may be transmitted, including the eyes. With genital herpes, it is wise to seek the help of a licensed health professional and review any self-help program planned for use.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
