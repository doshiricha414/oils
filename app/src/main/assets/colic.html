When they cry uncontrollably for an extended period of time, it is a great concern because we feel there is a need that we are not recognizing and fulfilling. Some define colic with “lots of 3s.” That is, a baby between 3 weeks and 3 months that cries for more than 3 hours at a time, for 3 or more days in a week, for 3 or more weeks in a row, has colic. As they grow older, they can actually learn to control crying, and it will subside.</p><p>The soothing touch of a loving parent will help them stop, or learn to stop, more rapidly than not. If that touch is coupled with the soothing affects of an essential oil, it will be even more helpful. Geranium, Lavender, and digestive blends have the soothing properties needed and are mild enough, with a carrier, for a baby’s sensitive skin.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/coriander" class="button halfsize">Coriander</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/digestZen" class="button halfsize">Digestive Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/ginger" class="button halfsize">Ginger</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/geranium" class="button halfsize">Geranium</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/peppermint" class="button halfsize">Peppermint</a></p><p><strong>Also consider: </strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/bergamot" class="button halfsize">Bergamot</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/blackPepper" class="button halfsize">Black Pepper</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/fennel" class="button halfsize">Fennel</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/marjoram" class="button halfsize">Marjoram</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/melissa" class="button halfsize">Melissa</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/wildOrange" class="button halfsize">Wild Orange</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p><strong>Application: </strong>Make a very mild dilution of Digestive Blend, Ginger or one of the oils above in a suitable <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil, such as coconut oil. Use a 5% dilution or less (5 drops in 1 teaspoon). One can also apply the carrier directly followed by one or two drops of the essential oil. Warm the hands to make for a soothing massage. Massage the baby’s tummy and lower back with circular motions with this ointment. Hold and cuddle the baby close afterwards. Make sure the baby is warm. Make a warm compress of the same ointment for the baby after the soothing massage and place on the stomach or back for a continuing effect of comfort.</p><p>Applying the ointment to the feet with a foot massage is also effective.</p><p><strong>Safety Precautions:</strong> Check safety data for oils that are safe to use with babies. Remember that a babies skin is sensitive. Also do not let the baby rub his or her eyes after touching the area with the oils.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
