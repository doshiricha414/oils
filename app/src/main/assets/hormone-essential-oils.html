    <p>Menopause can be initiated in three ways.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natural
      Menopause - Natural Menopause should be regarded as a normal
      adjustment reflecting a benign change in a women’s biological life
      from child bearing to a new period of personal fulfillment.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Premature Menopause (Toxicity Induced) - May be caused by toxins
      introduced by our lifestyle including:</p>
    <p>a)&nbsp; Dairy products (bovine growth hormones)</p>
    <p>b)&nbsp; Soy based products</p>
    <p>c)&nbsp; Plastics</p>
    <p>d)&nbsp; Personal care products</p>
    <p>e)&nbsp; Cooking with Teflon products</p>
    <p>note:&nbsp; Many modern products in our industrial society have
      xenoestrogen components and our bodies need to be strengthened
      against them. <span> <span><em>(Xenoestrogens</em> are manmade
          chemicals which mimic natural estrogen in the body thus
          causing hormone imbalance)</span></span></p>
    <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Artificial Menopause (Surgical Inducement) - Surgical removal of
      the uterus deprives the body of ovarian produced hormones needed
      during and after menopause resulting in poor:</p>
    <p>a)&nbsp; Bone health</p>
    <p>b)&nbsp; Skin health</p>
    <p>c)&nbsp; Sexual function</p>
    <p>d)&nbsp; Heart health</p>
    <p>e)&nbsp; Emotional stability</p>
    <p>Problems during menopause are typically abnormalities brought
      about by our industrialized culture and deviations from a healthy
      lifestyle.&nbsp; These often lead to estrogenic dominance
      (estrogen/progesterone balance) resulting in symptoms such as:</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp; Decreased sex drive</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp; Irregular abnormal periods</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp; Bloating and water retention</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp; Breast swelling and tenderness</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp; Mood swings / depression</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp; Weight gain</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp; Cold hands and feet</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp; Headaches</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp; Osteoporosis (progesterone osteoclast
      formation)</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Hormonal balance may be helped by:</strong></p>
    <p><span><strong>·</strong></span><strong>&nbsp; Reducing Stress</strong></p>
    <p><span><strong>·</strong></span><strong>&nbsp; Controlling
        toxicity </strong></p>
    <p><span><strong>·</strong></span><strong>&nbsp; Increasing
        progesterone </strong></p>
    <p><span><strong>·</strong></span><strong>&nbsp; Treating symptoms</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Reducing Chronic Stress – </strong>Chronic stress
      produces two negative effects on hormonal balance.&nbsp;
      Progesterone is converted to cortisol and adrenaline inhibits the
      proper interaction of progesterone within cells.&nbsp; Both of
      these lead to estrogen dominance and the resulting symptoms.</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To decrease adrenaline:
      use&nbsp; essential oils of Rose and Patchouli, both of which are
      found in the Blend for Women blend.</p>
    <p>Stress reducing oils and blends presented were:</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Citrus oils, Ylang Ylang, Roman
      Chamomile, Calming Blend, Grounding Blend, Joyful Blend,
      Frankincense, Lavender, conifer oils</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For &nbsp;stress reduction
      a combination with Sandalwood, Bergamot, Roman Chamomile, and
      Frankincense , when mixed together give a very pleasing
      aroma.&nbsp; Using 1 drop of each mixed together he would apply to
      the bottoms of the feet, the back of the neck, the temples and/or
      inhale the aroma.&nbsp; He has found this reduces stress
      immediately.</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, a must for those
      dealing with hormonal balance are the oils, blends, and procedures
      in the Massage Blend Technique.&nbsp; This should be done on a
      consistent and regular basis once a week, twice a month at the
      least, and more often if needed.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Controlling Toxicity –</strong> Toxicity should be
      addressed by first preparing the body for cleansing, using
      cleansing oils, and oils that support the liver and other organs
      that help in detoxifying the body.</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To strengthen the body in the
      cleansing process requires the proper vitamins and minerals such
      as those found in the Life Long Wellness pack and the Microplex VM
      supplement.</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use citrus oils every day as
      they are great detoxifying agents.&nbsp; Use regularly as in our
      environment we are exposed to toxins every day.&nbsp; Some use
      them in water, others use 10 or 15 drops in a capsule. To support
      the liver and other organs these essential oils and blends were
      suggested:</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Geranium may be topically
      applied over the liver and/or over the adrenal glands</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Grapefruit, Helichrysum, and
      Lemongrass may be taken internally with 4-5 drops in a capsule or
      applied topically over the liver.</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rosemary is a good support for
      the liver and an excellent decongestant for the liver.&nbsp; It
      may be applied topically or taken in a capsule.</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Digestive Blend is a good
      support for the liver.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Increasing progesterone –&nbsp; </strong>The imbalance
      between estrogen and progesterone often requires an increase in
      progesterone.&nbsp; This is best accomplished by enabling the body
      to increase progesterone naturally in the body.</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some common sources of
      progesterone are available.&nbsp; These include dietary
      supplements, creams, wild Mexican yams, soy, and dairy
      products.&nbsp; These must be selected carefully to be assured
      they are the variety with the desired progesterone and are not
      contaminated in other ways.</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An excellent source is again the
      Life Long Wellness pack and the Microplex VM
      supplement.&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the ingredients in VM the following
      assist the body in natural progesterone generation: the
      antioxidant vitamins A, C, E; the energy blend of B vitamins; and
      Zinc.</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thyme and Oregano are essential
      oils that will help the body naturally generate
      progesterone.&nbsp; Thyme is included in the Microplex VM
      supplement.&nbsp; Oregano may be used for short periods of time, a
      drop or two on the bottom of the feet for 8 to 10 days.</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Geranium topically applied over
      the liver, adrenal glands, and/or the kidney will help the
      generation of natural progesterone.</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frankincense should also be
      considered for disorders of the uterus such as fibroid cysts,
      etc.&nbsp; Use it to reduce existing abnormalities or consider it
      to prevent their formation.&nbsp; Frankincense will also balance
      the endocrine system.&nbsp; Use it by placing 2 or 3 drops under
      the tongue every night and every morning.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Treating symptoms – </strong>The symptoms associated
      with Hormonal Imbalance increase not only discomfort but the
      stress and should be addressed.</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Hot Flashes:</strong>
      Peppermint, Geranium, citrus oils, Grounding Blend and Clary
      Sage.&nbsp; Peppermint is an excellent way to cool down and may be
      effective on the feet at night, the back of the neck, on the
      chest, or some prefer a spray bottle with Peppermint and water for
      easy application.</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Fatigue:</strong>&nbsp;
      Ginger, Peppermint, the Life Long Wellness pack, and White
      Fir.&nbsp; The Life Long Wellness provides the balanced
      supplements to increase energy levels.&nbsp; Ginger, Peppermint,
      and White Fir individually or together are invigorating.&nbsp;
      Peppermint and White Fir inhaled or on the temples is effective
      and Ginger topically applied to the liver and adrenal glands is
      also helpful to some.</p>
    <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Libido:&nbsp;</strong>
      Ylang Ylang, Ginger, Peppermint, Joyful Blend, Clary Sage.&nbsp;
      All of these oils can be helpful.</p>
    <p>That these are general suggestions but each individual is
      different and achieving hormonal balance is sometimes a delicate
      exercise but he has seen tremendous success in helping those with
      these needs.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Estrogen dominance.</span></p>
    <p>This is the he primary factor for why we have all of the
      difficulties we have with hormones.</p>
    <p>Background material:</p>
    <p><em>“One of the biggest reasons women get into trouble with
        breast cancer is too much estrogen floating around in their
        bodies” Dr. Brett, Prevention Magazine</em></p>
    <p>Dr. Brett speaks of breast cancer but I would extend that to
      include osteoporosis, depression, anxiety and other symptoms that
      we typically assign to menopause. These are all a result of “too
      much estrogen floating around in our bodies”</p>
    <p>There are three different types of Estrogen available in the
      body:</p>
    <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natural Estrogen produced by the ovaries,
      adrenals, and fat tissue</p>
    <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xenoestrogen – manmade chemicals that mimic
      natural estrogen in the body.<br>
      <br>
      <em>The difficulty is we find them all throughout our
        culture.&nbsp; Foods we eat, the way we process our foods,
        animal products that have hormone enhancement are all sources of
        xenoestrogens.&nbsp; These are from outside our bodies and are
        unnatural or manmade estrogens that have inundated our system
        entirely. </em></p>
    <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phytoestrogens are dominant in the plant
      world. They are not natural in the body but are natural in plants
      and are in food sources that we have available.</p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
    </span>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">HRT (hormone replacement
        therapy).</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One misguided notion is that
      we are not estrogen dominant but in fact we are estrogen
      insufficient. That has led to this prevalence today of HRT
      (hormone replacement therapy.)</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another important concept
      associated with HRT is dosage. Any time we take any kind of a
      product into our body there are two kinds of dosage levels.</p>
    <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; A physiologic dose – the normal dose your body
      needs to function. It is not an overabundance but a level that
      allows your body to function properly.</p>
    <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; A pharmacologic dosage in the body – this is very
      different.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>It is above the
        normal body amount and in the case of hormone replacement
        therapy it inhibits the natural production of hormones.&nbsp; In
        fact the body perceives that estrogen is no longer needed
        because you have abundant resources from outside environment, in
        this case from HRT so the body stops its normal production of
        estrogen. </em></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em> Why is that important?
        Hormones are chemical messengers that interact with the
        cell.&nbsp; Xenoestrogens act in the same way and with the
        pharmacologic dosage we get from all the processed foods and
        other sources we are exposed to they block the receptors in our
        body cells and send a signal to our body that we no longer need
        to produce estrogen. This explain why in our modern society
        puberty much much earlier in girls and menopause much much
        earlier in women.</em></p>
    <p>More about Phytoestrogens – these are plant compounds that have
      actions similar to estrogen but in a much safer way than
      HRT.&nbsp; We are getting physiologic dosage levels not
      pharmacologic dosage levels. It is a much lower level and but much
      more powerful in another ways.</p>
    <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Phytoestrogens protect tissues from the effects of
      Xenoestrogens and other hormonal pollutants. The Phytoestrogens
      will help the body eliminate the unwanted Xenoestrogens.</p>
    <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; When Phytoestrogens are present in the body they
      can stimulate normal estrogenic responses.&nbsp; That is if we are
      estrogenic or estrogen insufficient they will stimulate and work
      with the body’s normal processes to stimulate normal hormonal
      processes. What it does not do is over stimulate and cause the
      body to stop producing its own normal levels of estrogen.</p>
    <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of their lower dosage levels it means we
      can consume them on a regular basis (and they come typically from
      fruits and vegetables).</p>
    <p>Things we can do.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>What are things we can do on a regular basis to fortify ourselves
      against the effects of estrogen dominance?</p>
    <p><strong>Eat whole foods.</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the best things we
      can do with the onset of menopause or to balance our hormones is
      to eat whole foods that have Phytoestrogens in them. This
      includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Whole grains</li>
      <li>Beans</li>
      <li>Seeds</li>
      <li>Nuts</li>
      <li>Fruits and vegetables</li>
      <li>Seed oils like flax seed oil</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>PB Assist.</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phytoestrogens in their
      natural form are healthy but are not as effective and may be
      unhealthy if separated out from their natural form.&nbsp; Even in
      their natural form the body cannot utilize them with out some
      help.&nbsp; This can come from the probiotics as found in PB
      Assist.</p>
    <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it is more that just
        having the Phytoestrogens available, more than just eating the
        right foods, it is making them bio-available to the body as
        well. The best way to do this is to have healthy intestinal
        flora to make the Phytoestrogens available to the body.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Essential oils.</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Essential oils can help us
      balance our hormones.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the ways to reduce
      estrogen dominance is to increase the dominance of progesterone in
      your body. Two oils to do this are Thyme and Oregano. There is a
      lot of research to suggest that. Use Oregano on the bottoms of the
      feet. Thyme is also very powerful and has the benefit that it can
      be used every single day. You get the value of having Thyme
      essential oil in the Life Long Vitality supplements.</p>
    <p><strong>Life Long Vitality supplements.</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life Long Vitality
      supplements provide an advantage in balancing hormones including
      the following ingredients that support hormonal balance including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&nbsp;B vitamins</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Zinc</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Vitamin A</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Vitamin E</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Tumeric</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Omega 3 fatty acids both land based and sea based.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are all foundations
      supplements you need.</p>
    <p><strong>Essential Oils with Phytoestrogens.</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oils that specifically have
      phytoestrogens as part of their content are Clary Sage, Basil,
      Coriander, Cypress and Lavender.&nbsp; These are very low dosages
      but that is what you want, a placeholder with the body’s cells so
      the body can produce its own estrogen.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apply oils to abdomen
      as this may increase the benefits.&nbsp; This is a common sense
      approach since with menopause or artificially induced menopause
      with the removal of the ovaries much of the estrogen that is
      produced is from the adipose cells of the abdomen area and
      applying oils in this area makes sense.</p>
    <p><strong>Massage Blend Technique.</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A recent research study use
      an aromatherapy massage with 56 women. They were&nbsp; given an
      aromatherapy massage using Lavender, Rose, and Geranium with some
      special massage strokes over the abodomen and arms once a week for
      eight weeks. They experienced a significant reduction in
      menopausal symptoms including depression and pain.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em> Compare this with the
        ATT which uses many or similar oils and also includes a rhythmic
        application of the essential oils. This is very interesting that
        the research shows that the RHYTHMIC application of essential
        oils can significantly reduce the symptoms of menopause and
        hormonal imbalance.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Geranium and Frankincense.</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Geranium and Frankincense
      also have value as they balance the body as a whole, they balance
      the whole endocrine system.</p>
    <p>How do you really test your hormones?</p>
    <p>Most people believe that the blood test is the way.&nbsp; This is
      what your physician would normally do. But looking at the serum
      levels are largely inaccurate for true hormone evaluation.</p>
    <p><em>Saliva testing is the model that many are going to at this
        time. Its less expensive, its easy to conduct and you can do it
        on your own. You can find laboratory in your area, they will
        send you the kit, you sample your saliva, send it to them and
        they will give you an accurate measurement of your hormonal
        activity within your body.</em></p>
