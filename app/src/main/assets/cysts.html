(see below for the differences between an abscess, cancer, cyst, or tumor.)&nbsp; There are many types of cysts that can form in various locations in the body.&nbsp; Most are benign and some will be reabsorbed by the body over time but essential oils seem to accelerate that process.&nbsp; Enclosed below are some of the more common types of cysts and following this is a more comprehensive list that expands on information originally found in Wikipedia.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Baker’s cyst – </strong>This is swelling in the knee as excess synovial fluid (the lubricant of the knee) builds up in the back of the knee.&nbsp; This can be caused by a tear in the meniscal cartilage, arthritis, or other knee injuries. If large enough to be felt it will be like a small water balloon and can become painful.</p><p><strong>Breast cyst – </strong>A common breast cysts occurs in those in their 30s or 40s as milk glands may grow up to one inch in diameter. These cysts, if large enough to be felt, may feel like a small water balloon, a lump with quite distinct edges. Breast cysts can be associated with fibrocystic disease wherein unusual fibrous growth of tissue in the breast can produce a mottled texture.&nbsp; Again these lumps will have well defined edges.&nbsp; These cysts are associated with hormone changes in the body and associated pain or discomfort can vary during the monthly menstrual cycle.&nbsp; These are generally benign growths and some will disappear over time.</p><p><strong>Ganglion cyst -</strong> These cysts form at joints in the body and are common in the area of the wrist.&nbsp; A common name used is Bible Bump coming from the concept if they were thumped with a heavy book they would disperse (might work temporarily).&nbsp; There is not a&nbsp; known reason for their formation.&nbsp; They are associated with the sheath that holds the synovial fluid around joints and tendons.&nbsp; They fill with a fluid similar to the synovial fluid and it may thicken or harden over time.</p><p><strong>Ovarian cyst –</strong>The most common type, functional ovarian cysts, form during the monthly menstrual cycle.&nbsp; There are other types of ovarian cysts that can result from diseases including cancerous cells. Functional cysts may form on or inside the ovarian glands and are not uncommon during child-bearing years. During the monthly cycle when an egg develops in a follicle it may not release in the normal way and the fluid that remains becomes a follicular cyst.&nbsp; If the egg is released but the remaining follicle accumulates blood the cyst is called a corpus luteum cyst.&nbsp; Each of these may become painful if they enlarge or break open. Spotting or bleeding may occur.</p><p><strong>Sebaceous cyst –</strong> These are usually found as lumps under the skin and are a result of a swollen hair follicle or some skin trauma.&nbsp; The sac of this cyst is filled with keratin, the protein used to form hair and nails in the body.&nbsp; These cysts are typically small and slow growing but they can, on occasion, become inflamed and tender or painful.&nbsp; This may include drainage of a pus like material.</p><p><strong>Comprehensive list </strong>(if the location is not self-evident from the name it is included in parenthesis):</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Acne cyst</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Arachnoid cyst (brain)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Baker's cyst or popliteal cyst (behind the knee joint)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Bartholin's cyst (vaginal)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Breast cyst</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Buccal bifurcation cyst (teeth)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Calcifying odontogenic cyst (jaw/teeth)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Chalazion cyst (eyelid)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Choroid plexus cyst (brain)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Colloid cyst (brain)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Corpus luteum cysts (ovarian)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Cutaneious cyst (skin)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Cysticercal cyst – cysticercosis from pork tapeworm (brain or muscles)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Dentigerous cyst (associated with the crowns of non-erupted teeth)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Dermoid cyst (a term used to describe a variety of cysts)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Epidermoid inclusion cyst (skin)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Epididymal cyst (found in the vessels attached to the testes)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Follicular cysts (ovarian)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Ganglion cyst (hand/foot joints and tendons)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Glandular odontogenic cyst (jaw)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Glial cyst (brain)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Gartner's duct cyst (vaginal or vulvar cyst of embryological origin)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Gorlin cyst (jaw/teeth)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Hydatid cyst (larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus, a tapeworm - liver or other organs)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Hydrocele (testicle)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Keratocyst (jaw, now classified as a tumor)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Liver cystic disease</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Meibomian cyst (eyelid)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Mucoid cyst (ganglion cysts of the digits)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Mucous cyst (lips)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Nabothian cyst (cervix)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Nasolabial duct cyst (upper lip)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Nasoalveolar cyst (upper lip)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Odontogenic cyst (teeth)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Ovarian cyst</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Paradental cyst</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Parapelvic cyst (kidney)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Paratubal cyst (fallopian tube)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Periapical cyst (teeth)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Pericardial cyst (chest)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Peritoneal cyst (lining of the abdominal cavity)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Pilar cyst (scalp)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Pilonidal cyst (skin infection near tailbone)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Pseudocysts (not actually a cyst but an inflammatory nodule)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Renal cyst (kidneys)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Pineal gland cyst (brain)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Polycystic ovary syndrome</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Popliteal cyst or Baker’s cyst (behind the knee joint)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Radicular cyst (teeth)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Residual cyst (jaw/teeth)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Sebaceous cyst (sac below skin)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Spermatocele (testicle)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Tarlov cyst (spine)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Trichilemmal cyst (scalp)</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Vocal fold cyst</p><p> </p><p>Abscess, cancer, cyst, polyp or tumor?</p><p>Here are some differences between terms used to describe “masses” or “lumps” that may form in the body.&nbsp; Common terms are abscess, cancer, cyst, polyp and tumor.&nbsp;</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Tumor – a mass of tissue or abnormal cellular growth.
