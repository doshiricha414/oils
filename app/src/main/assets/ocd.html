The person may well be aware of the cycle but often feel a strong urge to repeat them even to the point of disrupting their normal life.</p><p>Some of the unusual thoughts or fears are fear of germs or disease, fear of failure, a need for orderliness, a need to count or enumerate or a need for reassurance. These thoughts can lead to compulsions such as repeated washing or cleaning, unwillingness to touch others or things, constantly counting or rearranging, feeling a need to do routine tasks (eating or toiletries) in a specific order or collecting certain items.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/balance" class="button halfsize">Grounding Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/cypress" class="button halfsize">Cypress</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/geranium" class="button halfsize">Geranium</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/patchouli" class="button halfsize">Patchouli</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/ylangYlang" class="button halfsize">Ylang Ylang</a></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/bergamot" class="button halfsize">Bergamot</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/purify" class="button halfsize">Cleansing Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/sandalwood" class="button halfsize">Sandalwood</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/serenity" class="button halfsize">Calming Blend</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Many suggest using Patchouli, Grounding Blend or another of the recommended oils in a roller bottle and applying it behind the ears, on the wrists or on the bottoms of the feet 2 or 3 times daily.</p><p>If the odor is inviting rubbing 2 - 3 drops on the palms of the hands and cupping them over the nose and inhaling deeply is another successful application technique.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
