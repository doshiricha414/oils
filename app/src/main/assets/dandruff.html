                  <p><strong>Light Dandruff:</strong></p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Add 2 - 3 drops Melaleuca or
                    Blend for Women daily to Salon Essentials Protecting
                    Shampoo or other high quality shampoo.</p>
                  <p><strong>Heavy dandruff:</strong></p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Massage the following blend
                    into scalp nightly.&nbsp; Cover with shower cap if
                    necessary. Shampoo out the next morning:</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 1 teaspoon VCO or other
                    carrier</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 4 drops Lemon</p>

                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 4 drops Rosemary</p>
                  <p><strong>Flaking from bad hair products:</strong></p>
                  <p>Some note that harsh dandruff shampoos and other
                    products can damage the scalp and cause
                    flaking.&nbsp; A couple of suggestions to break this
                    cycle:</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Make a scrub for the scalp by
                    mixing&nbsp;4 -6 drops of Birch, Rosemary, or
                    Wintergreen into 1/2 ounce shampoo,&nbsp;and rub it
                    into the scalp by applying in&nbsp;1 inch partings
                    in the air. Leave on for 5&nbsp;minutes and process
                    with&nbsp;normal&nbsp;shampoo and conditioning
                    routine</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; To complete breaking the cycle
                    replace the harmful hair care products with high
                    quality shampoo and conditioner for future hair
                    care.</p>
                  <p><strong>Basic hair health:</strong></p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Eating well with Life Long
                    Vitality supplements builds strong and healthy hair.</p>
                  <p>Follow a&nbsp; good regular routine:</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Shampoo with Salon Essentials
                    Protecting Shampoo, add 1 - 2 drops of Rosemary to
                    slow hair loss.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Condition with&nbsp; Salon
                    Essentials Smoothing Conditioner, add 1 - 2 drops of
                    coconut or olive oil for dry hair, only use on tips
                    and/or outer half of hair shaft for oily hair. Let
                    the conditioner remain in hair 2 - 3 minutes before
                    rinsing for best results.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Dry hair and spray (spray is
                    especially effective after hair coloring or perms.)
                    with the following blend:</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 2 ounces of water</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 4 drops of Peppermint (or
                    other oil of choice)</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis) occurs with the
                    over production of skin oils and cells that then die
                    and flake off in much larger quantities than is
                    normal.&nbsp; This can occur on the scalp, eyebrows,
                    around the ears, or even on the chest. The excessive
                    dead cells appear as white or yellowish flakes and
                    may include some itching and some hair loss.&nbsp;
                    The condition is not considered serious although it
                    may be a source of embarrassment. About half the
                    population experiences dandruff at some time and it
                    happens equally among all races and genders. Among
                    youth and adults this is known as dandruff and with
                    infants the same condition is known as cradle
                    cap.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>With some the condition is chronic, for others
                    occasional.&nbsp; Triggers or increased risk come
                    from exposure to extreme heat and cold, stress,
                    fatigue, use of irritating soaps or lotions (e.g.
                    containing alcohol), and may be hereditary or a side
                    effect of some diseases.&nbsp; Dandruff is not an
                    allergic reaction, is not contagious, nor a result
                    of bad hygiene.</p>
                  <p><strong>An Important Note:</strong> Almost
                    everybody thinks all flakiness is dandruff, it
                    rarely is. Rather, it is almost always:</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; a&nbsp;build-up of hair spray
                    that eventually flakes off the hair shaft</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; skin cells damaged (killed
                    off) by hair products. (Interesting tidbit -
                    Dandruff shampoos create their own "job security".
                    They are usually effective at lessening or stopping
                    flaking&nbsp;but they do that by "chemically
                    scouring" the scalp, however, as you might expect,
                    that damages the next layer of&nbsp;developing skin
                    cells&nbsp;which creates more flakes, and the beat
                    goes on ad infinitum.)</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; normal sloughing off of dead
                    skin&nbsp;cells that get trapped in a&nbsp;build-up
                    from poor quality shampoo, conditioner and/or
                    styling product and it finally all flakes off
                    together</p>
