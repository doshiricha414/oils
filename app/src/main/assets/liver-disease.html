Diet and lifestyle can have a great impact so it is important to not compromise the liver with alcohol, drugs and pharmaceuticals (see Summary tab above) that are known to be harmful. Also reduce or eliminate sources of toxins such as additives to household and personal care products, insecticides, etc.</p><p>In general to cleanse and strengthen the liver the following have been suggested. Note that most liver conditions have developed over long periods of time and rebuilding will take consistent application with patience over weeks and months.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Cleanse the liver using the Detoxification Blend Detoxification Complex tablets daily with 3 - 5 drops of the Detoxification Blend blend to liver area daily.&nbsp;</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Note: The Detoxification Blend blend includes &nbsp;Clove, Geranium, Grapefruit and Rosemary that can be used individually if Detoxification Blend is not available.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Topically apply 2 - 5 drops of Myrrh across the back (about the bra line for ladies) daily.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Life Long Vitality supplements for balanced nutrition as a foundation.</p><p>Consider these additional helps:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Sufficient hydration with 1 - 2 drops of Grapefruit or Lemon added to each glass of water.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Periodic <a href="#/tab/info/massage-blend-technique" class="button halfsize">Massage Blend Technique</a> will promote homeostatis.</p><p>There are a host of different liver diseases that damage the liver in a variety of ways. Inflammation from toxins and infection is the major factor. Obstructions can develop that inhibit proper passage or flow of bile and blood. Direct cellular damage can come from chemicals and minerals as well as cancerous cells can develop damaging the liver and threatening life. Acute liver failure (failure that occurs in less than 48 hours) is rare, the more common failure happens over months or years and often results in a chronic condition. While the liver is the only organ in the body that can easily replace its own cells at some point this cannot continue. When damage to cells can no longer be reversed it is termed as cirrhosis of the liver.&nbsp;</p><p>The liver besides being the largest organ in the body is an important gland that does a number of incredible tasks. It is located strategically close to the heart and the stomach on the right of the abdomen. It receives blood directly from the heart through the hepatic artery and also receives nutrients from the intestines and the spleen through the portal vein. Its primary function is to filter the blood but beyond this it produces bile that is then stored in the gallbladder to be delivered to the duodenum to aid in digestion. The liver also produces certain proteins, enzymes, cholesterol and glycogen required for normal body functioning.</p><p><strong>Alcohol: </strong>The most common form of liver disease in North America is alcoholic hepatitis caused by the intake of alcohol.</p><p>Following are other common causes of liver disease (much of this was condensed from MedicineNet.com):</p><p><strong>Drugs and medications:</strong> Among those that are mentioned are an excessive amounts of acetaminophen (Tylenol, Panadol), or normal amounts of statin medications (Lipitor, Crestor, etc) or niacin also used for cholesterol control can cause liver problems. Many other antibiotic, autoimmune and cancer drugs produce adverse side effects involving the liver. Disulfiram (Antabuse) is used to treat alcoholics and is also mentioned.</p><p>Excessive amounts of some herbs and vitamins such as kava kava, ma-huang, comfrey and vitamin A plus some mushrooms can damage the liver as well.</p><p><strong>Infections: </strong></p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Infectious hepatitis (Hepatitis A, B,C, etc) is discussed separately (<em>see</em> Hepatitis).</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Other viral and non-viral infections, mononucleosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and valley fever for example, can cause inflammation of the liver along with their other symptoms.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Amebic liver abscess is caused by the parasite that causes amebic dysentery that can be carried from the intestines to the liver.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Pyogenic liver abscess – a pus filled abscess in the liver</p><p><strong>Other diseases:</strong> Many other failure mechanisms occur. This is a summary list with a very very abbreviated description:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; NASH or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (fatty liver) – an accumulation of fat</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Hemachromatosis – an inherited metabolic disorder with elevated iron</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Wilson's disease - an inherited metabolic disorder associated with copper</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Gilbert's disease – a benign condition with abnormal levels of bilirubin</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Cancer – two common forms are hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Metastatic cancer -secondary cancer of the liver that begins in another organ</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Autoimmune hepatitis – immune cells mistake the liver’s normal cells and attacks them</p><p>Blood flow related:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Budd Chiari syndrome - blood clots form in the hepatic vein. Causes include polycythemia (abnormallyelevated red blood cell count), inflammatory bowel disease, sickle cell disease, and pregnancy.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Congestive heart failure - poor heart function causes irregular blood blow</p><p>Bile flow related:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Gallstones – can obstruct ducts that drain bile from liver causing inflammation</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sphincter of Oddi – damage/abnormal valve for bile into the intestines</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis –scarring of bile ducts Biliary atresia - blockage in the ducts that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder</p><p>Liver malfunction that cause problems in other parts of the body:&nbsp;</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Hepatic encephalopathy: Increased ammonia can cause confusion, lethargy and coma.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Abnormal bleeding: If the liver is compromised blood clotting may not be normal</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Protein synthesis – Lack of proteins made in the liver can affect many bodily functions</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Portal hypertension: Liver damage can cause spleen swelling and varices (swollen veins) in the gastrointestinal tract from the esophagus to the anus</p></div></div></div></div></div>
