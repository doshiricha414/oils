That inflammation can come from a number of different sources the most common being from ingested toxins such as alcohol and the excess, or even the normal, use of certain medications. Other sources are viral, bacterial and fungal infections as well as others that include autoimmune hepatitis.</p><p>The present use of the word hepatitis normally refers to infectious hepatitis and the most common infectious hepatitis is a viral infection. There are at least seven types of viral infections of the liver. The most common of these are the viral infections known as Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. And finally the most common viral infection of the liver with a chronic affect is Hepatitis C that is estimated to be a chronic condition in 4.4 million Americans.</p><p>The symptoms of any of the hepatitis conditions seem to be similar so blood tests are necessary to specifically identify the source. Common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, weight loss, jaundice appearance and/or itchy skin. Hepatitis A is the most common of the infections but is a mild infection that may come and go without even being detected as the body’s immune system protects itself and it has no lasting or chronic effect. Hepatitis B and C are more invasive and both can develop into chronic hepatitis and affect a person for a lifetime. As mentioned Hepatitis C is the most common chronic condition affecting 3 or 4 times as many people as Hepatitis B.</p><p>These are all blood disorders and are not passed to others through casual contact such as hugging, sneezing, coughing or sharing eating facilities. It can be passed through practices that have blood to blood contact including drug culture activities, body piercing with non-sterilized instruments and other activities more common to underdeveloped nations.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/cilantro" class="button halfsize">Cilantro</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/melissa" class="button halfsize">Melissa</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/onGuard" class="button halfsize">Protective Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/zendocrine" class="button halfsize">Detoxification Blend</a></p><p><strong>Essential oils products:</strong> Life Long Vitality supplements, Zendorcrine Detoxification Complex</p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/balance" class="button halfsize">Grounding Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/basil" class="button halfsize">Basil</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/cinnamon" class="button halfsize">Cinnamon</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/geranium" class="button halfsize">Geranium</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/helichrysum" class="button halfsize">Helichrysum</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/teaTree" class="button halfsize">Melaleuca</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/myrrh" class="button halfsize">Myrrh</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/oregano" class="button halfsize">Oregano</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/rosemary" class="button halfsize">Rosemary</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/thyme" class="button halfsize">Thyme</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>One testimonial reports having success by simply taking a few drops of Frankincense in water every day.</p><p>The oils and products in this more complex protocol also had reported successes:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Life Long Vitality supplements for balanced nutrition as a foundation.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Cleanse the liver using the Detoxification Blend Detoxification Complex tablets daily.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Topically apply 3 - 5 drops Detoxification Blend blend to liver area daily.&nbsp;</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; One drop each Melissa and Protective Blend on thumb and then transferred to roof of mouth (hold for a few seconds to maximize transfer) 2 times per day.</p><p>Consider these additional helps:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Using Cilantro with Oil Pull daily.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Use Grounding Blend or other oils/blends to relieve anxiety and stress.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Periodic <a href="#/tab/info/massage-blend-technique" class="button halfsize">Massage Blend Technique</a> will promote homeostatis.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Soothing Blend Rub may be used topically for additional pain&nbsp;relief.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
