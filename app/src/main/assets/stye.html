It usually appears as a red irritation in the eyelash area.&nbsp; Often they are painful, especially if the eye is touched or rubbed.&nbsp; They can also cause burning or scratching on the eye itself and even blurred vision.</p><p>Styes commonly occur on the outside of the eyelid but, on occasion, the infected gland will be on the interior of the eyelid resulting in a small red bump visible on the outside. These types of bacterial infections are similar to pimples elsewhere on the skin and will usually drain and heal in 7 to 10 days without help.&nbsp; By using antibacterial essential oils this time can be reduced to 3 to 4 days.</p><p>A more difficult type of stye is know as a chalazion.&nbsp; In this instance the oil gland becomes blocked not allowing drainage.&nbsp; This can prolong the infection and require more time and consistency to clear up.&nbsp; In extreme cases a doctor can lance or prick the infected area to promote drainage.</p><p>Similar problems of the eyelids are xanthelasma: an age related, harmless, raised yellow area of the eyelid.&nbsp; And papillomas: skin bumps on the eyelids that are also harmless but may be cosmetically uncomfortable.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/helichrysum" class="button halfsize">Helichrysum</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/teaTree" class="button halfsize">Melaleuca</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/onGuard" class="button halfsize">Protective Blend</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Note: Be particularly careful to not allow essential oils to get on the eye itself.&nbsp; It is not dangerous but very uncomfortable.&nbsp; If it does happen apply additional coconut or olive oil to the area.&nbsp; Do not try to wash out with water.&nbsp; With children it may be best to use an eye patch after application of the oils to avoid rubbing.</p><p>Two suggested methods to apply oils are:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Using Lavender and Melaleuca (or other antibacterial oils) mix 2 - 3 drops each in the palm of the hand and then with the finger apply the oils carefully around the eyelid.&nbsp; Repeat this 2 to 3 times a day till the stye is gone.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Using Helichrysum and Frankincense (or other antibacterial oils) mix 1 or 2 drops each on the palms of the hands. Then carefully cup the hands over the eye and include the mouth and nose.&nbsp; Hold this position as the moisture from the breath and the oils mix and are carried to the area of the stye.&nbsp; Repeat 2 to 3 times daily until the stye is gone.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
