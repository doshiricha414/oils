                  <p>After months of anticipation a new life will come
                    into the world. A mother’s anticipation and
                    preparation come together in the miracle of
                    childbirth. A pregnancy normally takes 38 to 42
                    weeks measured from the first day of the last
                    menstrual period (or 266 days plus or minus 2 weeks
                    from the time of fertilization). Here is a brief
                    overview of what to expect just prior to and during
                    childbirth.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Signs of Labor</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Baby “drops” also known as
                    “lightening”. This is when the baby’s head drops
                    down into your pelvis in preparation for delivery
                    relieving pressure on the ribcage . May be a few
                    weeks before labor begins.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; More Braxton Hicks
                    contractions. Although Braxton Hicks contractions
                    may occur as early as the second trimester if they
                    become more frequent and intense it can be a signal
                    of pre-labor. (Braxton Hicks or false labor
                    contractions differ from real contractions in that
                    they are irregular in intensity and rhythm,
                    infrequent, for most more uncomfortable than painful
                    and do not increase in frequency or intensity but
                    rather taper off and then disappear.)</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; A bloody or brownish discharge
                    will pass, sometimes as a lump, sometimes as a
                    discharge over several days. This is the mucus plug
                    that has sealed off the womb from infection that
                    passes days before up to the onset of labor. This is
                    also known as “bloody show”.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Some experience frequent and
                    loose stools, diarrhea, just prior to labor.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; As labor is imminent (at least
                    within 24 hours) the "water breaks". This is the
                    term to describe when the amniotic sac that
                    surrounds the baby ruptures. .</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Contractions begin that are at
                    periodic intervals less than 10 minutes apart.</p>
                  <p>Stages of Labor</p>
                  <p><strong>Stage 1.</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Latent, active, and
                    transition phases.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Latent labor is the first
                    phase as contractions become fore frequent and the
                    cervix begins to dilate to approximately 3 to 4
                    centimeters.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Active labor follows as the
                    cervix dilates up to 7 centimeters with more
                    pressure on the back and abdomen with each
                    contraction.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Transition labor then follows
                    as the cervix fully dilates to 10 centimeters,
                    contractions are strong and more frequent coming
                    every 3 to 4 minutes and lasting 60 to 90 seconds.</p>
                  <p><strong>Stage 2. </strong></p>
                  <p>With the cervix completely open pushing and
                    contractions will bring the baby through the birth
                    canal. Normal delivery begins with the top of the
                    baby’s head first aided be the fontanels (soft
                    spots) allowing it to pass through the narrow canal.
                    Then the baby’s head crowns, meaning the widest
                    point of the head reaches the vaginal opening.
                    Continued pushing then delivers the baby’s shoulders
                    and body and the baby clears and the umbilical cord
                    separation can proceed.</p>
                  <p><strong>Stage 3.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>With the baby delivered the placenta then passes
                    through the birth canal and is the final stage of
                    this marvelous process.</p>
