The louse is a small, wingless, insect parasite that lives off of the blood or other elements of the skin.&nbsp; Since they do not fly or jump they are spread by human contact or exchange of common clothing, bedding, hair brushes, etc.&nbsp; The common symptoms of an infestation are reddish skin, inflammation and itching of the irritated skin.&nbsp;</p><p>Lice may be visually detected.&nbsp; They are about 1/8 inch long and their eggs (nits) are about 1/16 inch long. Head lice, common in children, are usually in the hair on the back of the neck or around the ears.&nbsp; The egg will be attached to the hair near the root.&nbsp; Pubic lice (crabs) are found in the pubic area and in armpits and other body hair including facial hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes.&nbsp; Body lice and their eggs will be found in the seams of clothing.</p><p>Head lice spend their entire life cycle on the human body so it is important when clearing an infestation to remove the lice and the nits.&nbsp; A common tool to have during treatment is a lice comb with tines close enough together to remove both the lice and the nits.&nbsp; Body lice do not live on the skin as head lice but rather live on clothing and move from there to the body to feed. Therefore cleaning and disinfecting clothing, bed clothing, furniture, etc. is necessary to prevent reoccurrence of infestations.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/eucalyptusRadiata" class="button halfsize">Eucalyptus</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/geranium" class="button halfsize">Geranium</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemon" class="button halfsize">Lemon</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/teaTree" class="button halfsize">Melaleuca</a></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/onGuard" class="button halfsize">Protective Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/purify" class="button halfsize">Cleansing Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/rosemary" class="button halfsize">Rosemary</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/terraShield" class="button halfsize">Repellent Blend</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Infestations of lice can range from mild to severe.&nbsp; Listed below are a range of alternatives depending on the severity of the infestation.&nbsp; In any case it is important to identify the source and also to treat surrounding areas, clothing, bedding, combs, brushes and other potential locations the lice can be passed on to others.</p><p><strong>Mild:</strong> Mix the following and apply to the scalp:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 2-5 drops Melaleuca</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 2-5 drops Lemon</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 5-10 drops <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil</p><p>Let stand for at least 1/2 hour.&nbsp; Shampoo with good quality shampoo with 2-5 drops of Melaleuca added to a teaspoon of shampoo.&nbsp; Follow with the Melaleuca shampoos daily for the following week.</p><p><strong>Moderate: </strong>Use the above protocol but modify with double the amount of Melaleuca and after the application cover the head with a shower cap for 1/2 - 1 hour.&nbsp;</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Follow this with a careful combing with a lice comb.&nbsp;</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Repeat daily until no signs of lice or nits are visible.&nbsp;</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Continue with Melaleuca shampoos daily for a minimum of a week.</p><p><strong>Severe:</strong> Mix the following and apply to the scalp every night for a week:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 10 drops Eucalyptus</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 5 drops Geranium</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 5 drops Lavender</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 5 drops Melaleuca</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 5-10 drops <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil (VCO)</p><p>Comb with a lice comb then cover with a shower cap for the night.&nbsp; Be careful to protect the eyes from any oils.&nbsp; Follow the next morning with a good quality shampoo with 2-5 drops of Melaleuca added to a teaspoon of shampoo.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
