Primary Sjogren’s is an instance of the disease when there is not associated illness, secondary Sjogren’s is the common situation when it is associated with another autoimmune disorder such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or scleroderma. Normally the immune system attacks the glands that make tears and saliva hence the common symptoms but often other parts of the body are affected with other painful symptoms. This can include joints, nerves, lungs, kidneys, circulatory and digestive systems. Those over 40 are most likely to have Sjogren’s and for no reported reason 90 percent are female.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/deepBlue" class="button halfsize">Soothing Blend</a>, DDR prime, <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a></p><p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong> Life Long Vitality supplements</p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/lemon" class="button halfsize">Lemon</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/teaTree" class="button halfsize">Melaleuca</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/oregano" class="button halfsize">Oregano</a></p><p> </p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>see also general suggestions for <a class="button halfsize" href="#/tab/conditions/sjogrens-syndrome">Auto-Immune Disorders</a>.</p><p>Consistent use of the Life Long Vitality supplements and 8 drops or 1 capsule of DDR Prime 2 times per day. 2 -3 drops of Frankincense 2 - 4 times daily under the tongue or internally with a spoonful of honey or in a capsule.</p><p>Use other oils for symptoms that may occur.

For candida use the GX Assist/PB Assist protocol (see Detoxification for more details). Others suggest this has <span>not</span> been helpful for their autoimmune disorders. If used consider that some with autoimmune disorders are particularly sensitive and should start this cleanse with 1 GX capsule daily for 2 days, if no skin or digestive reactions increase to 2 capsules for 2 days and then if no reactions to the prescribed 3 per day.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
