Babies on antibiotics or that are breast feeding when the mother is on antibiotics will have an increased possibility of having a diaper rash caused by candida.</p><p><strong>Diet.</strong> As a baby moves to solid foods, the introduction of some new types of solid foods, or a food allergy can diaper rash.</p><p><strong>Physical factors.</strong> A different type of diaper may cause rubbing in a new area, irritation from feces or urine if the diaper is left on too long or irritation from alcohol or other ingredients in commercial wipes can all lead to a rash.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/balance" class="button halfsize">Grounding Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/teaTree" class="button halfsize">Melaleuca</a></p><p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong> GX Assist, PB Assist</p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/digestZen" class="button halfsize">Digestive Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/romanChamomile" class="button halfsize">Roman Chamomile</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p><strong>Diaper Rash</strong></p><p><span>路</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make an ointment using one part Lavender or Melaleuca with a two parts of Extra Virgin Coconut Oil.&nbsp;</p><p><span>路</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clean and apply ointment with each diaper change.</p><p><span>路</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After healing apply cornstarch with each diaper change.</p><p><span>路</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some suggestions possible root causes that can also be addressed:</p><p>Possible candida (see Candida)</p><p>Pre-made wipes may have alcohol and be irritating.
