This membrane is a double structure that allows the pleural fluid to provide a protective buffer around the lungs. When this area becomes inflamed the&nbsp;<span>inner and outer</span>&nbsp;layer can rub together creating the sharp pain that those with pleurisy feel.</p><p>The inflammation can come from a variety of root causes. A viral or bacterial infection of the lungs is the most common source of pleurisy but other causes include trauma from an injury such as broken ribs or surgery involving the&nbsp;<span>pleural cavity</span>. It may also result as a side effect of other diseases such as pneumonia,&nbsp;<span>rheumatoid arthritis</span>, lupus, pulmonary embolism, tuberculosis or pancreatitis.</p><p>The symptoms of pleurisy are&nbsp;<span>sharp chest pains</span>&nbsp;that are more acute with breathing in and often lead the person to shallow breathing to avoid the pain. The inflammation and pain are usually on one side of the chest and can extend up to the shoulder or down to the stomach area.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/breathe" class="button halfsize">Respiratory Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/cypress" class="button halfsize">Cypress</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/thyme" class="button halfsize">Thyme</a></p><p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong>&nbsp;GX Assist/PB Assist, Life Long&nbsp;<span>Vitality supplements</span></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="#/tab/oils/basil" class="button halfsize">Basil</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/bergamot" class="button halfsize">Bergamot</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemon" class="button halfsize">Lemon</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/teaTree" class="button halfsize">Melaleuca</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/onGuard" class="button halfsize">Protective Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/oregano" class="button halfsize">Oregano</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/peppermint" class="button halfsize">Peppermint</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/romanChamomile" class="button halfsize">Roman Chamomile</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center"><span>Suggested protocols</span>:</h3><p>Cypress and Thyme applied topically to the painful area of the chest 2 -3 times daily.
