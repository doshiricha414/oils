                    Peppermint (Digestive Blend, Metabolic Blend) should

                  <p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong>
                    Life Long Vitality supplements are highly
                    recommended.</p>
                  <p><strong>Also consider:</strong> For other
                    conditions during lactation the following oils are
                    suggested as safe to use.&nbsp; Bergamot,
                    Invigorating Blend, Clary Sage, Grapefruit,
                    Geranium, Lavender, Lemon, Melaleuca, Patchouli,
                    Roman Chamomile, Sandalwood, Calming Blend, Wild
                    Orange, Ylang Ylang.&nbsp; It is reported that Dr.
                    David Hill notes that all dōTERRA essential oils and
                    blends are safe to use during pregnancy and
                    lactation with the consideration that Peppermint may
                    decrease milk supply.</p>
                  <h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3>
                  <p><strong>Increasing milk supply.</strong>&nbsp; Add
                    15 drops of Fennel or Geranium or 10 drops of Clary
                    Sage to 2 tablespoons of a <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil.&nbsp;
                    Topically apply to breasts and surrounding areas
                    once a day.&nbsp; Drink lots of water, relax, and be
                    patient.</p>
                  <p><strong>Decreasing milk supply. </strong>&nbsp;Add
                    3 - 5 drops of Peppermint to a cup of warm water
                    with honey to make a Peppermint tea and drink.&nbsp;
                    Or apply 3-5 drops topically with a <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil.</p>
                  <p><strong>Sore nipples. </strong>&nbsp;Use a snug
                    nursing bra with nursing cups as breast milk is very
                    healing for sore nipples and the cups will catch any
                    and sooth.&nbsp; Others recommend Lavender,
                    Helichrysum or Roman Chamomile applied with a
                    <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil.</p>
                  <p><strong>Cautions: </strong>Some report decreased
                    milk supply with Peppermint others do not.&nbsp; To
                    err on the side of caution Peppermint and blends
                    using Peppermint (Digestive Blend, Metabolic Blend)
                    should be limited if milk production is at risk.</p>
                  <p>It is important to understand that anything a
                    mother ingests will be passed through to breast
                    milk. The flavor of the milk is very much affected
                    by what the mother consumes. Some infants are more
                    sensitive to hot foods, therefore hot oils as well.</p>
                  <p>Others point out that <a href="#/tab/info/detoxification" class="button halfsize">detoxification</a> (GX Assist,
                    etc) can cause the eliminated toxins to go to the
                    breast milk and be passed on to the baby.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Breastfeeding is oft spoken of as one of the best
                    gifts a mother can give to her new child.&nbsp; Many
                    studies confirm numerous health and emotional
                    benefits for both child and mother.&nbsp; Today’s
                    society has suggested that man produced formulations
                    can replace this natural form of nutrition but the
                    evidence is staggering that this is not true.&nbsp;
                    Mother’s milk not only has the nutrients a baby
                    needs but also elements that will protect and fight
                    a number of diseases.&nbsp; For the baby these
                    benefits extend well beyond the time of
                    breastfeeding laying a foundation for a lifetime of
                    good health.</p>
                  <p>Benefits to baby and mother attributed to
                    breastfeeding</p>

                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;SIDS (sudden infant death
                    syndrome) is lower risk among breast fed infants</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many other benefits
                    reported including many that extend to adulthood</p>

                    pregnancies</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of health risks
                    for the mother are reported to be reduced including

                    including breast, cervical, endometrial and ovarian</p>

                    many positive, holistic suggestions on how to deal
                    with various issues.&nbsp; On the tabs above are a
                    number of ways essential oils and other natural
                    products can help with increasing and decreasing
                    milk supply and some cautions to consider while
                    breastfeeding plus other folks' experiences on using
                    essential oils while breastfeeding.</p>
