                  <h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3>
                  <p>Back pain many times includes the following
                    scenario:</p>
                  <p>1)&nbsp;There is an injury or degeneration that
                    leads to damage of nerve, muscle, or connecting
                    tissue.&nbsp; With the back most commonly nerve
                    pressure or damage is involved.</p>
                  <p>2)&nbsp; Pain may be accompanied by loss of feeling
                    and/or loss of strength</p>
                  <p>3)&nbsp; Inflammation compounds the pressure on the
                    nerve</p>
                  <p>4)&nbsp; As the back muscles try to compensate
                    there are often muscle spasms or cramps in the back
                    area that add additional pressure and intense pain.</p>
                  <p>This leads to the conclusion that the protocol
                    should include:</p>
                  <p>1)&nbsp; Oils for immediate pain relief</p>
                  <p>2)&nbsp; Oils for inflammation reduction</p>
                  <p>3)&nbsp; Oils to relax muscles and eliminate the
                    spasms</p>
                  <p>4)&nbsp; Oils for increased circulation to
                    facilitate quicker healing</p>
                  <p>5)&nbsp; Oils that heal and rebuild the damaged
                    tissue</p>
                  <p>BEST TO START HERE:</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The single best possible
                    step is to use the <a href="#/tab/info/massage-blend-technique" class="button halfsize">Massage Blend Technique</a> described
                    elsewhere on this website.&nbsp; Daily if
                    possible.&nbsp; Follow with a hot compress.</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Supplement this with the
                    oils listed below.</p>
                  <p>THEN COMBINE WITH THESE<span> (as necessary)</span>:</p>
                  <p>Oils for immediate pain relief:</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Soothing Blend, Birch, or
                    Wintergreen</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Apply 2 -3 drops
                    topically to the area where the pain is manifested
                    as often as required or use Soothing Blend
                    Rub.&nbsp; (For some Wintergreen may need to be
                    applied with a carrier.)</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the Massage Blend
                    Technique or other oils and blends applied to the
                    back more effective use a hot compress after the
                    application to drive the oils deeper into the
                    tissues and muscles.</p>
                  <p>Oils to reduce inflammation:</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Basil, Bergamot, Black
                    Pepper, Myrrh, Roman Chamomile, Rosemary, or
                    Wintergreen</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Apply topically to spinal
                    area.&nbsp; This is the location on the spine where
                    the nerve is being pinched and will probably be
                    different that where numbness or lack of strength or
                    even muscle cramps occur.&nbsp; For example, if
                    numbness and loss of strength is in the leg then the
                    lower back area where the sciatic nerve originates
                    may well be where there is nerve compression.&nbsp;
                    Two or three drops topically 2 - 3&nbsp; times
                    daily.&nbsp; (For some Wintergreen may need to be
                    applied with a carrier.)</p>
                  <p>Oils to relax muscles and eliminate spasms:</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Massage Blend, Lime,
                    Marjoram, Roman Chamomile</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Apply 2 - 3 drops
                    topically to the area where the spasm is occurring.</p>
                  <p>Oils to increase circulation:</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Invigorating Blend,
                    Cypress, Eucalyptus, Geranium, Lemon, or Peppermint</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Apply 2 -3 drops
                    topically to the spinal area 2 -3 times per day</p>
                  <p>Oils to heal and regenerate tissue:</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankincense,
                    Helichrysum, or Sandalwood</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Apply 1 -2 drops
                    topically to the spinal area 2 -3 times per day
                    followed by a hot compress</p>
                  <p>Also consider:</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Baths with oils will help
                    relaxation</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Diffusion of Invigorating
                    Blend, Lavender, or other relaxing oils at bed time

                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Back pain is a common term covering a wide variety
                    of situations primarily centered around the spinal
                    column.&nbsp; The spinal column is not only a major
                    structural member of the human anatomy but it also
                    houses the spinal cord, a key part of the Central
                    Nervous System and the primary conduit for exchange
                    of information between the Peripheral Nervous System
                    (limbs, organs, and glands) and the brain.&nbsp;
                    Injury or disease to the vertebrae, discs, or the
                    spinal cord can all be the source of back
                    pain.&nbsp; Also, since nerve signals from the
                    Peripheral Nervous System travel through the spinal
                    column, injury or disease of the spine can lead to
                    improper function or “mixed signals” in these other
                    parts of the body.&nbsp; Listed below are common
                    types of back problems and also a simplified chart
                    showing which of the vertebrae is the critical point
                    where nerves leave the spinal column to service
                    various parts of the body.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Muscle Strain</p>
                  <p>With heavy or awkward lifting, repeated
                    uncomfortable actions, over exertion, or with a fall
                    or other type of accident the muscles in the back
                    can be strained resulting in aching pain that can
                    last for days.</p>
                  <p>Whiplash</p>
                  <p>This is the common term for the injury resulting
                    from an abrupt jerking motion of the head resulting
                    in an injury to the neck.&nbsp; Common in our day of
                    auto crashes.</p>
                  <p>Disk degeneration</p>
                  <p>The disks between the vertebrae provide a cushion
                    and flexibility to the spine.&nbsp; They may be
                    damaged through accident or degenerate with
                    age.&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically with age the outer
                    covering of the disc will weaken causing the disc to
                    bulge and to flatten.&nbsp; The flattening can
                    eventually cause bone to bone contact between
                    vertebrae and become a source of pain.&nbsp; The
                    bulging can put pressure on the adjacent nerves and
                    be another source of pain.&nbsp; If the bulging adds
                    enough pressure the disc may rupture which is termed
                    a herniated disc.&nbsp; The pain in these cases can
                    be dull and achy or become sharp and shooting in
                    acute situations.</p>
                  <p>Sciatica <span> <em>(see also</em> <a
                        class="button halfsize"
                        href="#/tab/conditions/sciatica">Sciatica</a></span>)</p>
                  <p>The sciatic nerve is a large nerve pair that
                    travels from the lower spine to the legs and
                    feet.&nbsp; The nerve transitions from the spine
                    from the L4, L5, and S1 locations which are in the
                    lower part of the back.&nbsp; These are structurally
                    susceptible to stress with all the pressure that can
                    be applied to this part of the back.&nbsp; If the
                    nerves are pinched or damaged it will result in
                    pain, numbness, or weakness in any area from the
                    lower back to the feet.</p>
                  <p>Facet joints</p>
                  <p>The vertebrae are linked together with the facet
                    joints (see diagram).&nbsp; These joints can
                    degenerate with arthritis or age.&nbsp; As they
                    degenerate they can become inflamed and
                    painful.&nbsp; Prolonged sitting or remaining in one
                    position can exacerbate the pain and standing or
                    flexing the back can provide some relief.&nbsp; Over
                    time this can lead to osteoarthritis.</p>
                  <p>Osteoarthritis</p>
                  <p>As the facet joints deteriorate the body may try to
                    compensate by producing a bony growth commonly
                    called a bone spur.&nbsp; This bony structure can
                    narrow the passages that nerves go through and
                    result in pressure on those nerves.</p>
                  <p>Failed Back Syndrome</p>
                  <p>Many journals now list this as a common back
                    problem.&nbsp; This is the result of back surgery
                    that has left the person with no improvement or even
                    a worsened condition.&nbsp; Statistics now suggest
                    that this happens in 15 to 40 percent of back
                    surgeries.</p>
                  <p>Spinal stenosis</p>
                  <p>This is a narrowing of any of the channels that
                    carry nerves thereby putting pressure on the
                    nerves.&nbsp; It is a term that applies to many of
                    the conditions above.&nbsp; It can result in pain,
                    numbness and/or loss of strength in limbs and can
                    affect bladder and bowel functions as well.</p>
                  <p>The Central Nervous System (brain and spinal cord)
                    are connected to other parts of the body through the
                    Peripheral Nervous System.&nbsp; If damage is done
                    to the spine it can have an effect on other parts of
                    the body.&nbsp; The chart below is a simplified
                    diagram of where various nerves leave the spinal
                    column traveling to other limbs, organs, and glands
                    of the body.</p>
