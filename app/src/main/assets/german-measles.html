These are both viral infections that develop a rash but they are two completely different diseases. German Measles is a milder infection only lasting a few days but is the one that is dangerous if it infects a pregnant woman and can be passed to the unborn child and can cause serious birth defects. Measles, if contracted, takes a longer time to run its course and in a small number of instances can lead to serious pneumonia or encephalitis.</em></p><p>German measles (aka rubella, three day measles) is a contagious viral infection characterized by a rash. It is passed through the air with close contact to the source 1 week before and up to 2 weeks after the rash is noticeable. The rash is light red spots and usually starts in the head area and may travel down the body. Symptoms that accompany the rash are usually very mild and may include fever (99-100° F/37.2-37.8° C), tender lymph nodes, headache, listlessness and runny nose. In fewer cases there may be blood shot eyes, muscle or joint aches and bruising.</p><p>The MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, rubella) is common and protects many although some adults that have been vaccinated can become infected and a booster vaccine is available to women that have become pregnant.</p><p>The MMR vaccine itself is controversial as there are some that are convinced that it may lead to autism whereas others cite studies of large numbers that show there is no connection.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/eucalyptusRadiata" class="button halfsize">Eucalyptus</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/teaTree" class="button halfsize">Melaleuca</a></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/coriander" class="button halfsize">Coriander</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/onGuard" class="button halfsize">Protective Blend</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Lavender topically to relieve symptoms of rash.</p><p>Eucalyptus and Melaleuca internally to minimize the viral infection.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
