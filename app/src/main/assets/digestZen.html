      <div class="feature"><span class="label1">Digestive Blend</span>
        is a proprietary blend of seven different essential oils,
        formulated to provide soothing, all-natural support for a
        healthy gastrointestinal tract.&nbsp; It is known as tummy tamer
        blend, due to its ability to aid in digestion, soothe occasional
        stomach upset, and maintain overall digestive health.
        <blockquote>
          <p>Almost everyone has the occasional digestive problem.&nbsp;
            Thankfully, research has established that many essential
            oils are <em>very</em> supportive of the digestive system.
          </p>
          <p>These oils, such as peppermint and ginger, contain
            compounds that have been recognized as powerful agents, to
            help restore normal balance in the digestive system.&nbsp;
            Other oils, like tarragon, fennel, caraway, coriander and
            anise oils, have specific attributes that, when blended with
            peppermint and ginger, add to the overall efficacy of the
            blend. </p>
          <p><span class="label1">Digestive Blend</span> takes advantage
