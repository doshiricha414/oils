These are both viral infections that develop a rash but they are two completely different diseases. German Measles is a milder infection only lasting a few days but is the one that is dangerous if it infects a pregnant woman and can cause serious birth defects. Measles, if contracted, takes a longer time to run its course and in a small number of instances can lead to serious pneumonia or encephalitis.</em></p><p>Measles (aka rubeola, red measles) is a highly contagious viral infection that is rare in those parts of the world where modern immunization is widespread. The infection itself is characterized by a red or dark red rash that can cover the entire body. The rash typically starts on the forehead and then spreads down the body and can be very itchy. The rash is accompanied by a high fever, red eyes, runny nose, a cough, muscle pain, light sensitivity and small red spots with blue-white centers that appears inside the mouth known as Koplik’s spots.</p><p>A very large percentage of those exposed to another with measles will acquire the disease unless they are immunized. The virus is spread through contact or contaminated droplets from the infected persons mouth or nose while coughing or sneezing. The person with measles is contagious starting 1 or 2 days before the rash is evident to 4 days after. The newly infected person will go through a 8 – 12 day incubation period before their symptoms appear. The rash will then last 4 – 7 days.</p><p>Immunization is common in the US and is more available throughout the world. The MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, rubella) itself is controversial as there are some that are convinced that it may lead to autism whereas others cite studies of large numbers that show there is no connection.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/eucalyptusRadiata" class="button halfsize">Eucalyptus</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/teaTree" class="button halfsize">Melaleuca</a></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/coriander" class="button halfsize">Coriander</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/onGuard" class="button halfsize">Protective Blend</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Lavender topically to relieve symptoms of rash.</p><p>Eucalyptus and Melaleuca internally to combat the viral infection.</p><p>Protective Blend as protection if unvaccinated and being in or traveling to an area that may have cases of measles.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div></div></div></div></div>
