                  <p>Lyme disease (the name comes from the town of Old
                    Lyme, Connecticut where the disease was first
                    identified in 1975) is a bacterial infection of the
                    bacterium borrelia burgdorferi (also know as
                    spirochete) which is carried by ticks from deer or
                    mice to humans.&nbsp; The infection has now been
                    found in North America and also in Europe.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Early symptoms of the infection may not be noticed
                    or if noticed resemble flu symptoms such as fever,
                    headaches, body aches, and muscle pain.&nbsp; A
                    “bulls eye” rash may occur at the spot of the tick
                    bite.&nbsp; Antibiotics at this early stage will
                    likely provide complete recovery.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>If not treated properly other symptoms may occur
                    over time and persist disrupting a normal active
                    life.&nbsp; These later symptoms and complications
                    may include chronic problems including arthritic
                    type pain with inflammation of the joints.&nbsp;
                    There may also be brain or nervous system chronic
                    problems including difficulty with memory,
                    concentration, and vision.&nbsp; Also reports have
                    included symptoms such as widespread itching and
                    mood changes.</p>
                  <p>Even after the bacterial infection has been
                    arrested some report continued symptoms.&nbsp; This
                    has been labeled post-Lyme disease syndrome.&nbsp;
                    Extended symptoms are most commonly arthritic or
                    heart related.</p>
                  <p>The Lyme disease tick:</p>
                  <p>The infected tick is commonly in wooded or grassy
                    rural areas and most dangerous for transmittal in
                    the spring, summer, to early fall season.&nbsp; You
                    must be bitten by a tick carrying the bacterium (not
                    all ticks are carriers) and have it attached to your
                    body to get Lyme disease.&nbsp; Use common sense
                    procedures to avoid ticks if you are in suspected
                    areas:</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Use an insect repellent</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wear long sleeve shirt</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wear high boots, tuck
                    pants into socks</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Check for ticks (light
                    colored clothing make them easier to spot)</p>
                  <p>Deer ticks are small, especially in the nymph
                    stage, so they may go undetected so watch for these
                    signs.&nbsp; The area of the bite usually will
                    redden with the "bulls eye" pattern within 3 to 30
                    days.&nbsp; Flu like symptoms will occur.</p>

                  <h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3>
                  <p>There are multiple phases of Lyme disease:</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;During the initial
                    infectious stage (immediately after the tick bite)
                    the use of an antibiotic protocols will be effective
                    and if started early enough will eliminate further
                    complications.</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;If the initial phase went
                    undetected or untreated and some period of time
                    passed before being diagnosed then the antibiotic
                    protocols should be coupled with cleansing protocols
                    and must be extended over a longer period of
                    time.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;If the infection is
                    arrested but symptoms continue (post-Lyme disease
                    syndrome) then the antibiotics and cleanses may not
                    be necessary but Candida should be considered while
                    addressing the symptoms.</p>
                  <p>Nutritional foundation</p>
                  <p>In all cases the Life Long Vitality supplements
                    should be used.&nbsp; Double the recommended use of
                    EOMega from 4 capsules per day to 8 for those
                    considered to be in the second phase as described
                    above.</p>
                  <p>Antibiotic protocol</p>
                  <p>Put the following in a 00 capsule:</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12 drops Protective
                    Blend</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 drops Oregano</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 drops
                    Frankincense</p>
                  <p>One capsule per day or 14 days, rest 14 days and
                    repeat.&nbsp; During the 14 rest days apply 2 drops
                    of &nbsp;Lemongrass and 1 drop of Oregano on each
                    foot before bedtime.</p>
                  <p>With the antibiotic procedure be aware of the
                    possibility of Herxheimer reaction and if rashes or
                    other symptoms occur reduce the daily dosage while
                    continuing the procedure.&nbsp; Remember that just
                    the presence of a tick does not mean someone has
                    Lyme disease.&nbsp; Most do no start an antibiotic
                    protocol unless the symptoms appear.</p>
                  <p>Cleanse (detoxify)</p>
                  <p>Use the full 15 day GX Assist/PB Assist procedure 3
                    times:</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GX Assist (30
                    softgels, taken 1 softgel, 3 times a day, over 10
                    days)</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;followed by PB
                    Assist (15 capsules,&nbsp; taken 1 capsule, 3 times
                    a day, over 5 days)</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rest 10 days.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat 2 more
                    times.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Other cleanses are described elsewhere and should
                    be considered like Detoxification Blend for
                    detoxifying the liver, kidneys, colon, lungs, and
                    skin.</p>
                  <p>Again be aware of the Herxheimer reaction and if
                    rashes or other symptoms occur cut the daily dosage
                    while continuing the procedure.&nbsp; Return to full
                    dosage as Herxheimer reactions subside.</p>
                  <p>Supplements/Antibiotics/Cleanse sequence</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If multiple
                    protocols are necessary consider the
                    following:&nbsp; The Life Long Vitality supplements
                    can be taken along with the antibiotic and cleansing
                    procedures.</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the antibiotic
                    and cleansing procedures are both needed it is
                    prudent to sequence them starting with the
                    antibiotic protocol, a 14 day rest, and then the
                    cleanse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Candida possibility</p>
                  <p>Be aware if heavy antibiotic treatment has occurred
                    there is a possibility of the body's immune system
                    being weakened and an overgrowth of Candida
                    happening.&nbsp; If this appears to be the case
                    follow the procedures recommended to help with
                    Candida.</p>
                  <p><strong>Pain, Comfort, Immune System</strong></p>
                  <p>For those in the second phase of Lyme disease or
                    suffering from post-Lyme disease syndrome using the
