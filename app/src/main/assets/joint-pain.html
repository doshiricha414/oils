It can range from mild irritation to debilitating pain and can last from a few hours to a chronic condition lasting years. The most common factor in joint pain is inflammation and often, even if the root cause cannot be addressed, limiting the inflammation can be a great benefit. The proper balance of rest and exercise is also a consideration and varies greatly from condition to condition.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong></p><p><strong>General: </strong><a href="#/tab/oils/deepBlue" class="button halfsize">Soothing Blend</a>,<strong> </strong><a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/marjoram" class="button halfsize">Marjoram</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/peppermint" class="button halfsize">Peppermint</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/wintergreen" class="button halfsize">Wintergreen</a></p><p><strong>Warming: </strong><a href="#/tab/oils/cinnamon" class="button halfsize">Cinnamon</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/clove" class="button halfsize">Clove</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/eucalyptusRadiata" class="button halfsize">Eucalyptus</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/oregano" class="button halfsize">Oregano</a></p><p><strong>Pain: </strong>Birch, <a href="#/tab/oils/cypress" class="button halfsize">Cypress</a>, Frankincense, <a href="#/tab/oils/ginger" class="button halfsize">Ginger</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/rosemary" class="button halfsize">Rosemary</a></p><p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong> Soothing Blend Rub, Life Long Vitality supplements</p><p> <h3 class="text-align-center"><strong>Suggested protocols:</strong></h3></p><p>A pain blend such as Soothing Blend is highly recommended for joint pain.
