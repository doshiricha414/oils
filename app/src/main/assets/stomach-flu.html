As the name implies this is a viral infection and can come from a variety of viruses including adenovirus, astrovirus, caliciviruses, norovirus and rotavirus. The latter two being common among children while caliciviruses is a more common infectious agent among adults. None of these virus strains are related to those responsible for the common cold or flu (influenza) that affect the respiratory system.</p><p>Symptoms appear rapidly after contacting the infection, usually with 4 to 48 hours.&nbsp; Symptoms usually will include abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Fever and headache may also occur but symptoms will usually differ from respiratory influenza (the flu) which typically will include high fever, muscle aches, fatigue and respiratory congestion.</p><p>As with any viral infection antibiotics will not help. The greatest danger for many, especially children and those with weakened immune systems, is that because of diarrhea and vomiting the body can become dehydrated. This should be monitored closely.</p><p>Also note the stomach flu is not to be confused with influenza or the bronchial flu that includes a number of serious strains (West Nile, Swine, Bird, H1N1 and H3N2). See flu.</p><p> </p></div></div></div></div></div>
