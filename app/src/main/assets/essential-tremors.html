Although appearing similar to a symptom of Parkinson’s disease it is not a result of it or any other disease. It also does not lead to Parkinson’s although it can coexist with it. It does have a genetic component and may repeat from generation to generation.</p><p>The tremors are grouped into three general categories.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rest tremors occur when a body part or limb is completely supported and at rest such that no muscle contraction is necessary but the muscles activate the unnecessary trembling.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Postural tremors occur when a body part is held motionless against the natural force of gravity and trembling happens. Pointing with the hand extended would be an example.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kinetic tremors occur when a body part is voluntary moving in a task and trembling happens. Drinking from a glass or speaking with a tremor would be examples.</p><p>One or all categories can occur in an individual. The most common area for essential tremors is the hands, much less the head, then lower limbs and voice. Tremors are exacerbated with lack of rest and stress. Essential tremors progress with aging at variable rates in individuals for unknown reasons. In fact, although the underlying cause seems to be neurological they have not identified the cause and there are no other associated neurological problems found in those suffering from essential tremors.</p><p> </p></div></div></div></div></div>
