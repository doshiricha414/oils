This is most commonly near the uterus on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, outer surface of the uterus, ligaments that support the uterus, and other surfaces of the abdominal cavity. Very rarely it may be found in other parts of the body.&nbsp;</p><p>This endometrial tissue outside the uterus responds to the menstrual cycle in some ways like the tissue within the uterus including thickening and bleeding.&nbsp; This process then leads to problems of discomfort and pain with each menstrual cycle.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/clarySage" class="button halfsize">Clary Sage</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/claryCalm" class="button halfsize">Monthly <a href="#/tab/oils/whisper" class="button halfsize">Blend for Women</a></a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/deepBlue" class="button halfsize">Soothing Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/sandalwood" class="button halfsize">Sandalwood</a>, Blend for Women</p><p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong> Phytoestrogen Lifetime Complex</p><p><strong>Also consider: </strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/cypress" class="button halfsize">Cypress</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/eucalyptusRadiata" class="button halfsize">Eucalyptus</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/geranium" class="button halfsize">Geranium</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/onGuard" class="button halfsize">Protective Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/rosemary" class="button halfsize">Rosemary</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Dr. David K. Hill in his presentation on Hormonal Grounding Blend gives this important observation, <em>"Frankincense should also be considered for disorders of the uterus such as fibroid cysts, etc.&nbsp; Use it to reduce existing abnormalities or consider it to prevent their formation.&nbsp; Frankincense will also balance the endocrine system.&nbsp; Use it by placing 2 or 3 drops under the tongue every night and every morning."</em></p><p><strong>Pain and Cramps </strong>- here are protocols folks have found successful:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span> Apply 2 - 4 drops of Solace or Clary Sage/Cypress topically to the abdomen.&nbsp; Use a warm compress on abdomen after applying oils.</p><p><span>•</span> Take 8 -12 drops of Sandalwood internally in a capsule at the outset.&nbsp; On the second day take 6 - 8 drops of Sandalwood in a capsule.</p><p><span>•</span> Also consider Basil, Clary Sage, Soothing Blend, Geranium or Peppermint applied topically to lower abdomen or lower back. For additional help cup &amp; inhale and use a warm compress after applying oils.<span><em>&nbsp;<br />(note: Dr. Hill and many others point out that different oils work for different folks and there is usually a need to do some experimentation to determine what works best for each individual)</em></span></p></div></div></div></div></div>
