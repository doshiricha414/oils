    <p>A close relative to ginger, <span class="label1">cardamom</span>
      has a long history as a cooking spice.&nbsp; It is also know to be
      beneficial to the digestive system, in a variety of ways.&nbsp;
      Cardamom is commonly used to help ease occasional indigestion and
      calm occasional stomach upset, helping to maintain an optimal
      gastrointestinal balance.&nbsp; It also promotes clear breathing
      and respiratory health, while promoting a positive mood. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="label1">Cardamom</span> oil is steam distilled
        from the seeds of the <em class="noLink">Elettaria cardamomum</em>
        plant.&nbsp; It yields an oil that is spicy, fruity, warm and
        balsamic, and can be used aromatically, topically and by
        ingestion. </p>
      <p>It is known (by some) as being the most expensive cooking
        spice.&nbsp; But its other properties demonstrate its real
        value.&nbsp; <span class="label1">Cardamom</span> oil has
        profound effects on the respiratory system, due to its high <span
          class="noLink">1,8-cineol</span> content, which promotes clear
        breathing and respiratory health.&nbsp; Its distinct scent can
        calm the occasional stomach upset, while uplifting the mood. </p>
      <p>Native to Southeast Asia, <span class="label1">cardamom</span>
        is added to traditional Indian sweets and teas for its cool, yet
        minty aroma and flavor.&nbsp; However, the oil we offer is
        extracted from <em class="noLink">Elettaria cardamomum</em>
        seeds grown in Guatemala, with high quality testing standards. </p>
