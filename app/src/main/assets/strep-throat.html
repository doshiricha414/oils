It is most common in mid age children and during the colder months of the year.&nbsp; A common sore throat differs in that it is usually a viral infection.&nbsp; Both are contagious and can be passed from child to child or person to person in any place with close contact.&nbsp;</p><p>Both the strep and the viral sore throat can have a painful soreness in the throat but the common sore throat may be accompanied by coughing, sneezing, or running nose while these symptoms will not usually occur with a strep infection.&nbsp; The symptoms of strep include a sudden, severe sore throat, swollen tonsils, and whitish spots on a very red throat.</p><p>Luckily, since many essential oils are both antibacterial and antiviral, the same protocols will generally be effective with either.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemon" class="button halfsize">Lemon</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/marjoram" class="button halfsize">Marjoram</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/onGuard" class="button halfsize">Protective Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/oregano" class="button halfsize">Oregano</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/sandalwood" class="button halfsize">Sandalwood</a></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/cypress" class="button halfsize">Cypress</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/eucalyptusRadiata" class="button halfsize">Eucalyptus</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/geranium" class="button halfsize">Geranium</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/teaTree" class="button halfsize">Melaleuca</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/myrrh" class="button halfsize">Myrrh</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/peppermint" class="button halfsize">Peppermint</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/thyme" class="button halfsize">Thyme</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Mild: At outset 2-3 drops Lavender topically to throat every 15-20 minutes.</p><p>&nbsp;Strong: Place a mouthful of warm water in a shot glass (small glass) and add 2 drops each of Lemon and Protective Blend.&nbsp; Gargle as long as possible and then swallow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeat every hour or two until pain subsides.&nbsp; Continue then 2 or 3 times a day for at least two days.</p><p>Strongest: Add 1 - 2 drops Oregano. This may be too hot (uncomfortable) for some.&nbsp;</p><p>For children: Use Mild or Strong oils recommended above applied topically on throat, around ears, and on bottoms of feet. At least 3-4 times daily for 2-3 days.</p><p>If treatment begins after heavy soreness has developed, use the previous application coupled with either a topical neck ointment, lymphatic massage, and/or a neck compress. Make the ointment with 10 drops of <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil and 1 drop each of Lemon and Oregano oil. Wrap the neck with a warm compress with 1 or 2 drops of oil added. If laryngitis has developed, use Oregano and Marjoram or Frankincense as a gargle.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
