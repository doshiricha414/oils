                  <p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a result of
                    hormone imbalance. The reasons are not understood
                    but for some reason the female sex hormones,
                    estrogen and progesterone, become imbalanced and
                    there is usually increased androgens or male
                    hormones.&nbsp; In PCOS, during ovulation, the
                    egg(s) normally released do not mature and release,
                    but instead form the small cysts that are a common
                    symptom.</p>
                  <p>Other symptoms may include heavy bleeding during
                    the menstrual cycle, irregular or lack of periods,
                    difficulty in getting pregnant, depression,
                    unexplained increase in weight, changes in hair
                    growth, and acne or skin disorders.&nbsp; Symptoms
                    will vary greatly from individual to individual.
                    This may be detected at any age during child bearing
                    years and seems to run in families. If not addressed
                    it leads to a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and
                    higher cholesterol levels.</p>

                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; The root cause of PCOS is
                    hormonal balance and the observations and
                    suggestions by Dr. Hill on this are very important.
                    Check also Hormonal Balance.<span

                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Also Dr. David K. Hill in this
                    presentation on Hormonal Grounding Blend gives this
                    important observation, <em>"Frankincense should
                      also be considered for disorders of the uterus
                      such as fibroid cysts, etc.&nbsp; Use it to reduce
                      existing abnormalities or consider it to prevent
                      their formation.&nbsp; Frankincense will also
                      balance the endocrine system.&nbsp; Use it by
                      placing 2 or 3 drops under the tongue every night
                      and every morning."</em></p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; The following is a protocol
                    some have found helpful:</p>
                  <p>Use natural tampons without chlorine. Blend:</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 8 drops Clary Sage</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 8 drops Frankincense</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 8 drops Lavender</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 8 drops Cypress</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 2 TBSP melted virgin coconut
                    oil</p>
                  <p>Soak the mixture into the tampon.&nbsp; Insert over
                    night.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Do nightly for one week, then switch for a week to:</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 8 drops Frankincense</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 8 drops Geranium</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 5 drops Myrrh</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 2 TBSP grape seed oil</p>
                  <p>For those unable to use tampons the blend may be
                    administered with a syringe</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;or applied topically to the feet and female
