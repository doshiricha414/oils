                  <p>Here is a summary of the experiences that others
                    have had.&nbsp; As with many health concerns
                    Fibromyalgia is best helped on multiple
                    levels.&nbsp; Experiences include help for pain,
                    cleansing, strengthening the immune system, building
                    nutritional balance, and emotional support.&nbsp;
                    Couple these with the possibility that many have
                    used prescription medication and the transition or
                    addition of oils may require patience to find a
                    proper balance.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><strong>PAIN:&nbsp; </strong>Soothing Blend,
                    Massage Blend and other specific oils applied
                    topically to specific points of discomfort.&nbsp;

                    on a frequent and consistent basis.</p>
                  <p><strong>NUTRITIONAL BALANCE: </strong>Almost
                    everyone insists that using nutritional supplements
                    such Life Long Vitality supplements are a
                    must.&nbsp; Additionally eliminate harmful foods and
                    habits.</p>

                    a capsule.</p>
                  <p><strong>STRENGTHENING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM:&nbsp; </strong>A
                    major component of the Massage Blend Technique
                    mentioned previously is the application of essential
                    oils and blends to assist in building strength in
                    the body’s immune system.&nbsp; Beyond this,
                    commonly recommended is PB Assist (ProBiotics),
                    designed to support healthy digestive functions and
                    immunities.</p>
                  <p><strong>CLEANSING:&nbsp; </strong>Both a liver and

                    and Detoxification Blend blend addresses the liver,

                    details.</p>
                  <p>·&nbsp; Gastrointestinal - The theory that a root
                    cause of autoimmune disorders is Candida is detailed
                    in autoimmune disorders. To address Candida use the
                    GX Assist cleanse detailed under&nbsp;
                    Detoxification. Note that some with autoimmune
                    disorders are particularly sensitive and should
                    start this cleanse with 1 GX capsule daily for 2
                    days, if no skin or digestive reactions increase to
                    2 capsules for 2 days and then if no reactions to
                    the prescribed 3 per day.</p>
                  <p><strong>EMOTIONAL SUPPORT:&nbsp; </strong>These
                    types of health concerns can take an emotional toll

                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Fibromyalgia is a syndrome that includes long-term,
                    body wide pain in the muscles and connective
                    tissues.&nbsp; This characteristic pain may be
                    accompanied by fatigue, headaches, and difficulty
                    with sleep, anxiety, and depression.&nbsp; Females
                    in the age group 20 to 50 are the most likely to
                    suffer from fibromyalgia.</p>
                  <p>A definite cause has not yet been identified but
                    research shows that those that suffer might have a
                    difference in the central nervous system that makes
                    them more sensitive to pain.&nbsp; Some suggest this
                    difference in the CNS could have been as a result of
                    childhood stress or prolonged periods of
                    stress.&nbsp; Others suggest that physical or
                    emotional trauma may trigger the syndrome.</p>
                  <p>Since there are no definite abnormalities with a
                    physical exam some physicians consider it
                    controversial to diagnose the symptoms as
                    fibromyalgia.&nbsp; The National Institutes of
                    Health and the American College of Rheumatology
                    disagree and the latter suggests a test involving
                    nine paired tender points (18 different points) on
                    the body.&nbsp; The points are located:</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. At the back of the neck
                    behind the ear, where the neck muscles attach to the
                    base of the skull.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. About halfway between
                    the base of the neck and the tip of the shoulder.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. At the spot where the
                    back muscles attach to the shoulder blade.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. On the front of the
                    neck above the collarbone.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Just to the right and
                    left of the breastbone (sternum) about 2 in. below
                    the collarbone.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. On each forearm just
                    below and to the outside of the crease of the elbow.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Just above and to the
                    outside of each buttock.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. On the outer upper leg
                    just behind the bony part of the hip (this point is
                    easier to find when standing).</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. On the inside of each
                    knee.</p>
                  <p>The guidelines are that when these tender points
                    are pressed and if eleven or more have pain it is a
                    clear diagnosis of fibromyalgia.</p>
                  <p>Is Fibromyalgia an autoimmune disease?</p>
                  <p>Although some suggest fibromyalgia is an autoimmune
                    disease many experts say that it is not.&nbsp; <br>
