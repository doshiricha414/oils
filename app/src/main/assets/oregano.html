    <p><span class="label1">Oregano</span> is one of the most potent and
      powerful essential oils, and has been used for centuries, in
      traditional medicine, for its cleansing and immune-boosting
      properties.&nbsp; Hippocrates, the father of medicine, used <span
        class="label1">oregano</span> as a cleansing agent, as well as
      for digestive and respiratory support. </p>
    <p>The primary chemical components of <span class="label1">oregano</span>
      are <span class="noLink">carvacol</span> and <span
        class="noLink">thymol</span>, both in the phenols group, which
      possess purifying and antioxidant properties. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="label1">Oregano</span> oil is steam distilled from
        the stems and leaves of the <em class="noLink">Origanum vulgare</em>
        plant, yielding an oil with a heavy, herbaceous, sharp, green,
        camphoraceous, spicy, pungent aroma that really lingers.&nbsp;
        The <em class="noLink">Origanum vulgare</em> plant is a member
        of the Lamiaceae (also called Labiatae, or mint) family of
        flowering plants.&nbsp; The oil contains phenolic acids and
        flavonoids, making it an <em>outstanding</em> antioxidant. </p>
      <p>No one would <em>ever</em> confuse <span class="label1">oregano</span>
        with perfume; however, it is used as a fragrance component in
        soaps, colognes and perfumes, especially fragrances for
        men.&nbsp; But, what it lacks as a <em>perfume</em>, it <em>more</em>
        than makes up for in other important ways.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="label1">Oregano</span>, in addition to being a
        popular cooking spice, supports healthy digestion.&nbsp; When
        diffused, <span class="label1">oregano</span> acts as an
        enhancer and equalizer in essential oil blends, and can help
        maintain healthy respiratory function. </p>
      <p>One drop, taken daily, can help enhance healthy immune
        function; <span class="label1">oregano</span> should be taken
        more frequently, when seasonal threats are high, or as needed,
        to further enhance immunity. </p>
      <p>Due to its high <span class="noLink">phenol</span> content,
        caution should be taken when inhaling or diffusing <span
          class="label1">oregano</span> oil; only one to two drops is
        needed.&nbsp; Additionally, oregano should be diluted with
        carrier oil, when applied to the skin. </p>
      <p><span class="label1">Oregano</span> oil is certified by the <span
          class="label1">FDA</span> as <strong>GRAS</strong>; however,
        it is a very "hot" oil, so dilution is a carrier oil is
        recommended for ingestion. </p>
      <h3>Primary benefits of oregano oil </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Used as a powerful cleansing and purifying agent </li>
        <li>Provides immune-enhancing benefits </li>
        <li>Supports healthy digestion and respiratory function </li>
        <li>Excellent source of antioxidants </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Uses for oregano oil </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Take one drop daily, to enhance immunity, when seasonal
          threats are high. </li>
        <li>Rub <span class="label1">oregano</span> essential oil and
          fractionated coconut oil on the bottom of your feet, to help
          enhance your immune system. </li>
        <li>For use in the bath, dilute 1-3 drops of<em> </em><span
            class="label1">oregano oil</span> in body gel or shampoo,
          and add it to the bath water.&nbsp; Never just add this oil to
          the water, as it will "puddle" on the surface and can burn
          sensitive tissues. </li>
        <li>Put one drop, in place of dried oregano, in spaghetti sauce,
          pizza sauce or on a roast. </li>
        <li>Put 10 drops in a 16-ounce spray bottle, with water, for a
          surface spray. </li>
        <li>As an cleanser, the diluted oil can be used in cloths, to
          wipe down kitchen and bathroom counter tops. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How to use </h3>
      <p><span class="label1">Oregano</span> oil is intended for
        aromatic, topical or dietary use.&nbsp; Due to its high <span
          class="noLink">phenol</span> content, dilution is required
        when using topically; and I'd recommend it for internal use, as
        well. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="label1">Diffusion:</span> Use three to four
          drops in the diffuser of your choice. </li>
        <li><span class="label1">Internal use:</span> Dilute one drop in
          4 fl oz of liquid.&nbsp; A fatty liquid, like almond or hemp
          milk would work best.&nbsp; Do not use water. </li>
        <li><span class="label1">Topical use:</span> Dilute one to two
          drops with carrier oil, then apply to desired area.&nbsp; See
          additional precautions below. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="label1">Cautions:</span> Possible skin
        sensitivity.&nbsp; Keep out of reach of children.&nbsp; If you
        are pregnant, nursing, or under a doctor's care, consult your
        physician.&nbsp; Avoid contact with eyes, inner ears and
        sensitive areas. </p>
