Anxiety, alcohol, caffeine, stress are common primary causes of insomnia.&nbsp; Secondary insomnia can come from physical or psychological factors such as depression, indigestion, restless leg syndrome, or a chronic pain condition.</p><p>Essential oils are a blessing to those who suffer from not being able to sleep. The sedative and relaxing properties of so many oils provide a wide range of choices. Lavender is very highly recommended. Clary Sage, Frankincense, Marjoram, Orange, Rosemary, Ylang Ylang, or blends like Grounding Blend, Calming Blend will also have very good relaxing or sedative properties.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/clarySage" class="button halfsize">Clary Sage</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/serenity" class="button halfsize">Calming Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/ylangYlang" class="button halfsize">Ylang Ylang</a></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/marjoram" class="button halfsize">Marjoram</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/romanChamomile" class="button halfsize">Roman Chamomile</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/rosemary" class="button halfsize">Rosemary</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/wildOrange" class="button halfsize">Wild Orange</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Many have found one of these simple solution effective:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 2-3 drops of Lavender or Calming Blend on hands and rubbed across pillow at bedtime</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 1-3 drops of Clary Sage under the tongue at bedtime</p><p>A key to insomnia is finding the best oils or blends and the best personal application technique.
