                    suggestion for the PB Assist+ capsule or the

                    these <a href="#/tab/info/detoxification" class="button halfsize">detoxification</a> protocols should be scaled

                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Rheumatic fever is now a relatively rare disorder
                    in developed countries although in the US there have
                    been more reported cases in the poorer
                    neighborhoods. This health concern is initiated from
                    a strep throat (bacterial infection of group A
                    streptococcus). If untreated, in a few situations
                    (less than 0.3%), the antibodies that are created by
                    the body to attack the bacteria begin to attack the
                    body’s own tissue. Therefore some characterize it as
                    a type of&nbsp;<span>autoimmune disorder</span>.
                    This then causes an inflammatory response that is
                    responsible for many of the symptoms reported. The
                    parts of the body most commonly affected are the
                    joints but it can also attack the heart, rheumatic
                    heart disease (RHD), causing scarring of the valves
                    in the heart.</p>
                  <p>Rheumatic fever is more common in children and the
                    symptoms begin to appear 2 – 4 weeks after the
                    occurrence of the strep infection. Symptoms most
                    noted are joint swelling and pain primarily in
                    knees, elbows, ankles and wrists. Since, in about
                    half the instances, the heart if affected there can
                    be&nbsp;<span>chest pain</span>&nbsp;or general
                    weakness. Others have noted fever,&nbsp;<span>abdominal
                      pain</span>, nosebleeds or skin irritations. Also
                    noted are some instances of Sydenham’s chorea, a
                    nervous disorder characterized by involuntary jerky
                    movements.</p>
