The remaining quarter who do have symptoms have diverticular disease.</p><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lack of dietary fiber is thought to be the main cause of diverticula (pouches protruding outwards from the colon). Fiber helps our stools remain soft. If you do not consume enough dietary fiber and the stool is hard there may be more pressure or strain on the colon as muscles push the stool down - this pressure causes diverticula to occur. Diverticula occur when weak spots in the outside layer of colon muscle give way because stuff in the inner layer has managed to squeeze through.</p><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study found no link between diverticular disease and consumption of nuts, seeds, and corn.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
