                    Use a warm compress on abdomen after applying oils.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span> Take 8 -12 drops of Sandalwood

                    topically to lower abdomen or lower back. For
                    additional help cup &amp; inhale and use a warm
                    compress after applying oils.<span><em>&nbsp;<br>
                        (note: Dr. Hill and many others point out that
                        different oils work for different folks and
                        there is usually a need to do some
                        experimentation to determine what works best for
                        each individual)</em></span></p>

                  <p><span>•</span> Remember that heavy exercise

                  <p><span>•</span> The oils above are all suggested as
                    helpful by both early and contemporary experts.
                    Consider cup &amp; inhale and/or use a warm compress
                    after applying oils topically to the abdomen.</p>

                  <p>The normal menstrual period varies significantly
                    from individual to individual.&nbsp; Some perfectly
                    regular, some unpredictable; some 3 days, some 6 or
                    7 days; some light, some heavy.&nbsp; Menstrual
                    problems vary as well.&nbsp; The more common
                    complaints are:</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Cramps or painful periods
                    (dysmenorrhea) are light to severe pain in the lower
                    abdomen.&nbsp; In young women before child bearing
                    these may occur with no underlying cause and they
                    tend to become milder with age or disappear after
                    giving birth.&nbsp; For others there may be
                    underlying reasons for cramps and pain such as
                    endometriosis or uterine fibroids and addressing
                    these issues can relieve this monthly discomfort.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Heavy bleeding (menorrhagia)
                    either from heavy flow or prolonged bleeding can be
                    severe enough for discomfort and in some cases
                    limiting normal activity.&nbsp; Some&nbsp;
                    experience heavier than normal bleeding in the
                    premenopausal years (average menopause is 51 years).</p>
                  <p>Other menstrual conditions related to missed
                    periods or lack of periods.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Oligomenorrhea is the term
                    used to describe infrequent periods.&nbsp; If a
                    woman has polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), caused
                    by hormonal imbalance,&nbsp; this is one of the
                    symptoms that may be manifested.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Amenorrhea is the term used to
                    describe the absence of menstrual periods.&nbsp; If
                    a young woman does not have periods by age 16 or an
                    older woman stops having periods before menopause
                    and without pregnancy it is considered
                    amenorrhea.&nbsp; This may also be a symptom of PCOS
                    or another cause is extreme exercise.&nbsp; For
                    female athletes or those very physically active
                    females hormone production may be altered resulting
                    in exercise-induced amenorrhea.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Health issues that may be associated with menstrual
                    problems are:</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; PCOS (polycystic ovary
                    syndrome) – a hormone imbalance already mentioned</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Uterine Fibroids – Fibrous,
                    non-cancerous tumors, within or on the walls of the
                    uterus</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Endometriosis – Edometrium
                    tissue that normally lines the uterus can grow
                    outside of the uterus (on ovaries, fallopian tubes,
                    and a variety of locations) and respond to the
                    menstrual cycle building up monthly and discharging
                    blood with associated pain and discomfort.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; POF (premature ovarian
                    failure) – when ovaries stop their normal
                    functioning in women under 40.</p>
