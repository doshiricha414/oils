      <p><span class="label1">Marjoram</span>, also referred to as
        "wintersweet" or "joy of the mountains", is one of the most
        common herbs found in kitchens around the world.&nbsp; In
        antiquity, the Romans knew <span class="label1">marjoram</span>
        as the "herb of happiness"; to the Greeks, it was the "joy of
        the mountains".&nbsp; It has long been used in culinary dishes,
        imparting a unique flavor to soups, stews, dressings and sauces;
        in Germany, this herb is known as the "Goose Herb", for its
        traditional use in roasting geese. </p>
      <p>In traditional Austrian medicine, <span class="label1">marjoram</span>
        was used to promote gastrointestinal health and to purify the

        benefits for the cardiovascular system. </p>
      <p><span class="label1">Marjoram</span> oil is steam distilled
        from the leaves of the <em class="noLink">Origanum majorana</em>
        plant, yielding an oil with a warm, herbaceous, woody scent,
        with a high content of <span class="noLink">linalool</span> and
        <span class="noLink">terpinen-4-ol</span>.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><span class="label1">Marjoram</span> is closely related to
        oregano, and has similar properties.&nbsp; It is certified <strong>GRAS</strong>
        by the <span class="label1">FDA</span>, so it is safe to
        ingest. </p>
