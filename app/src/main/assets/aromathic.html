                  <p>A common way to enjoy the benefits of essential
                    oils is diffusion.&nbsp; An ultrasonic atomization
                    diffuser is great in releasing oils into the air.
                    This is done silently and allows the human body to
                    easily absorb those minute ion particles.</p>
                  <p>Properly diffused oils are known to kill bacteria
                    and virus, improve mental clarity, enhance or calm
                    emotions, and increase feelings of well-being. Over
                    longer periods of time, these diffused oils
                    strengthen the immune system, reduce mold, and
                    reduce unpleasant odors.</p>
                  <p><strong>Direct Inhalation</strong></p>
                  <p>Many times it is not convenient to use the
                    diffuser.&nbsp; Here are suggestions on other handy
                    techniques to enjoy the benefits of oils aroma.</p>
                  <p><strong>Inhaler:</strong>&nbsp; Empty inhalers,
                    similar to a "Vicks inhaler" may be purchased and
                    any oil or blend can be dripped onto the wick.&nbsp;
                    They are very handy to carry in a pocket or purse
                    and last for weeks.</p>
                  <p><strong>Cup and Inhale:</strong>&nbsp; With cup and
                    inhale, place a couple drops of an oil or blend or
                    use the residue on the hands after a topical
                    application.&nbsp; Then stimulate the olfactory
                    cells by cupping the hands over the nose and
                    breathing deeply.</p>
                  <p><strong>Make a spritz:</strong> using 5-10 drops of
                    oil with Â½ cup of clean water.&nbsp; Put the
                    mixture in a small spray bottle and shake well prior
                    to uses.</p>
                  <p><strong>Make a steam tent: </strong>&nbsp;Add
                    several drops of oil to a steaming hot bowl of
                    water.&nbsp; Place a towel over the head and let it
                    drape around the bowl and breathe in the
                    vapors.&nbsp; This is especially valuable for sinus
                    problems, coughing or colds.</p>
                  <p>When traveling by car or plane, the immune system
                    is under particular stress.&nbsp; Apply a few drops
                    of oil to cotton balls, cotton pads or tissue.&nbsp;
                    In the car, place them in the heating and cooling
                    vents.&nbsp; The air passing over the oil diffuses
                    the scent into the air.&nbsp;</p>
