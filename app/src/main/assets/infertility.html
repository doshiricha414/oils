                  <p>Primary infertility is defined as not being able to
                    get pregnant despite having frequent, unprotected
                    sex for at least a year, or for at least six months
                    if the woman is age 35 or older. Secondary
                    infertility is a term referring to couples who have
                    been pregnant at least once but have not been since.
                    The cause for infertility may be with the woman, the
                    man or both partners.</p>
                  <p>The most common causes among women that are
                    mentioned include tumors, fibroids, polyps, cysts,
                    defects in reproductive tract, thyroid disorders,
                    candida infection, diabetes, hormonal disorders,
                    PCOS, PID, obesity, excessive exercise, drugs,
                    excessive alcohol, poor nutrition and age. Among men
                    certain infections, environmental pollutants
                    (radiation, etc), birth defects, certain
                    pharmaceuticals, heavy use of drugs or alcohol and
                    age.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>In a healthy couple under age 30 who have sex
                    regularly, the chance of getting pregnant is about
                    25 - 30% per month. After the woman is age 35 – 40
                    the chances are reduced considerably.</p>
