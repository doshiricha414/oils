Often applying directly to the affected area is most effective. Headaches originate from certain places, like some might be sinus headaches.&nbsp; Common sense says that cup and inhale, applying it to the temples, and/or applying it to the sides of the nose would be appropriate.&nbsp; Other headaches start at the back of the neck.&nbsp; Massaging a selected oil to the neck and shoulders offers relief.&nbsp; Complete the process by applying a compress to the effected area.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pressure points identified in <a href="#/tab/info/reflexology" class="button halfsize">reflexology</a> or acupressure have also proven effective places to apply oils.</p></div></div><div class="row sqs-row"><div class="col sqs-col-6 span-6"><div class="sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1403733309022_100315"><div class="sqs-block-content"><h2>Direct Application</h2><p>Administer directly to an effected area for pain relief or for protection from infection.&nbsp; An oil (with or without a carrier) in a spray or a salve works well.&nbsp; Appropriate situations to consider direct application include burns, rashes, fungal infections, cuts, scrapes bumps, bruises and bites.</p><p>Additionally, areas of inflammation and associated pain may be included, use topically for muscle aches, joint pains, arthritis and gout.&nbsp; For upset stomachs or digestive problems, direct application on the stomach (especially for children) is appropriate.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><div class="col sqs-col-6 span-6"><div class="sqs-block quote-block sqs-block-quote" data-block-type="31" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1403733309022_100227"><div class="sqs-block-content"><figure>

Massage therapists attend hundreds of hours of instruction to learn proper techniques of massage.&nbsp; It would be ideal to employ an expert every time a rub down is needed, but that’s not always feasible.&nbsp; For a very useful discussion of oils and massage consider the book <em>Essential Oils Overview and Reference Guide</em>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Massage for Infants &amp; Small Children</h2><p>Essential oils are of great benefit for babies and young children using massage techniques.&nbsp; Clearly, their skin is very sensitive and extreme care should be taken to use a <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil during a massage.&nbsp; A 2-5% carrier dilution is appropriate.&nbsp;</p><p>With those precautions in mind, recognize that an essential oils massage for a baby encourages a great fun and bonding time with parents.&nbsp; Massage for babies is also a proven technique for pain relief of many kinds including digestive discomfort and colic as well as other health concerns.&nbsp; When using the correct essential oil, a massage is a physical type of ‘lullaby.’</p><p>A highly effective method with babies and small children is to massage their feet with essential oils.&nbsp; It is considered a safe area to apply oils that might sometimes be considered too strong or concentrated for sensitive baby skin.&nbsp; Still, use care with “hot oils, their feet will<em> </em>develop calluses but not until they begin walking.&nbsp; With stronger oils the use of a carrier is recommended.&nbsp;</p><p>Compresses with a damp, warm towel are comforting and therapeutic to a baby that is suffering from discomfort or pain.&nbsp; Apply directly to the affected area(s), i.e., to the stomach area for tummy discomfort, etc.<br /><br />Here are some further tips to keep in mind when massaging babies:</p><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·<span style="font-size:7.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Warm hands under warm running water before beginning.</p><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·<span style="font-size:7.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Find a relaxing time for both the baby and the administrator.&nbsp; Prior to nap or bedtime is ideal.</p><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·<span style="font-size:7.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Talk to the baby in kind gentle tones while massaging.</p><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·<span style="font-size:7.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Warm the oil in the hand first before applying.</p><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·<span style="font-size:7.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Use gentle soft rotary strokes.</p><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·<span style="font-size:7.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Be gentle when applying to the tummy area.</p><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·<span style="font-size:7.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Keep oils away from the eyes, genitals and mucus membranes.</p><p>Keep in mind that babies do not know better than to touch their eyes.&nbsp; Therefore, massage only those area(s) that can be clothed or covered after the massage to prevent transfer to the sensitive spots.&nbsp; For instance, place socks on the infant or child after massaging their feet.</p><h2>Baths and Soakings</h2><p>Baths and soaking provide another method to topically apply essential oils and blends.</p><ul><li><p style="margin-left:.5in"><strong>Full bath.&nbsp;</strong> A full bath with essential oils can be a great source of relaxation and help.&nbsp; Before entering a bath, do these two steps: In warm bath water, place oils 4-6 drops of selected essential oil.&nbsp; Agitate the water and oil to prevent concentration in any one area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every so often, repeat the agitation to keep the oils from pooling in one area.</p></li><li><p style="margin-left:.5in"><strong>Jacuzzi.&nbsp; </strong>Oils placed in a Jacuzzi help destroy bacteria as well as produce a pleasant aroma and mind relaxant.&nbsp; All essential oils have antibacterial properties which can prevent hot tub rash. Users may choose an oil based on personal preference or aroma.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p style="margin-left:.5in"><strong>Suana. </strong>&nbsp;Essential oils mixed with the water can be used in a sauna bath to create a pleasant effect.&nbsp; 1 or 2 drops per cup of water is usually sufficient depending on the oil selected.</p></li><li><p style="margin-left:.5in"><strong>Showers.&nbsp;</strong> Temporarily plug the drain.&nbsp; Place 2-6 drops of oil or blend on a wet washcloth or bathing sponge.&nbsp; Rub over the entire body when showering.&nbsp; Enjoy the aroma of the steam and the effects of the oils.</p></li><li><p style="margin-left:.5in"><strong>Sitz bath.&nbsp;</strong> Run enough water in the tub to cover the person’s backside.&nbsp; Pour and mix in 2-4 drops of selected oils.&nbsp; Mix the water and oil well or blend as recommended for the specific health concern.</p></li><li><p style="margin-left:.5in"><strong>Foot bath. </strong>&nbsp;There are a variety of oils, combinations and blends for various foot ailments.&nbsp; 4-6 drops released into a vessel large enough for both feet filled with warm water. Use a dispersing agent or mix well with the water.&nbsp; Soak the feet for as long as the solution is comfortable.</p></li><li><p style="margin-left:.5in"><strong>Hand soak.&nbsp;</strong> <span>This is similar to a footbath but a smaller container to fit the hands is used.&nbsp; Reduce the number of drops of oil to 2-4.&nbsp; </span>Use a dispersing agent or mix well with the water<span> and soak hands as long as the temperature is comfortable.</span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div>
