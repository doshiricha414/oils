Functional cysts may form on or inside the ovarian glands and are not uncommon during child-bearing years. During the monthly cycle when an egg develops in a follicle it may not release in the normal way and the fluid that remains becomes a follicular cyst.&nbsp; If the egg is released but the remaining follicle accumulates blood the cyst is called a corpus luteum cyst.&nbsp; Each of these may become painful if they enlarge or break open. Spotting or bleeding may occur.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong> Frankincense, Oregano, Sandalwood</p><p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong> <a href="#/tab/info/massage-blend-technique" class="button halfsize">Massage Blend Technique</a>, Topical Blend, Life Long Vitality supplements</p><p><strong>Also consider: </strong> Massage Blend, Basil, Soothing Blend, Helichrysum, Peppermint, Wild Orange</p><p><strong>A simple suggestion.</strong>&nbsp; Soak the end of an organic tampon in 8 - 10 drops Frankincense and Sandalwood and insert at night while sleeping.&nbsp; Repeat nightly.</p><p><strong>Another suggestion:</strong></p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Blend: 8 drops Clary Sage, 8 drops Frankincense, 8 drops Lavender, 8 drops Cypress, and 2 tablespoons melted virgin coconut oil</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Soak the mixture into the tampon&nbsp; Use natural tampons without chlorine.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Insert overnight.
