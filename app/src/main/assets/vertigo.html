                  <p>Vertigo is a false sense of motion or that your
                    surroundings are in motion that results in
                    difficulty in maintain balance and even
                    nausea.&nbsp; The body’s sense of balance comes from
                    the vestibular organ in the inner ear.&nbsp; This is
                    organ is connected to the brain via the vestibular
                    nerve.&nbsp; Vertigo can originate from problems in
                    either the inner ear or the brain.</p>
                  <p>Problems in the inner ear is called peripheral or
                    vestibular vertigo. BPPV is usually brief periods of
                    intense dizziness triggered by some movement of the
                    head. This temporary or transient peripheral vertigo
                    can come from inflammation (bacterial or viral
                    infection), chemical insults, or physical
                    trauma.&nbsp; Chronic vertigo is most commonly
                    caused by BPPV (benign paroxysmal positional
                    vertigo).&nbsp; Less frequently other diseases
                    including Meniere’s may be the cause.&nbsp; One
                    theory for BPPV suggests it results from small
                    crystals of calcium carbonate (ear rocks or
                    otoconia) that normally occur but because of damage
                    to the inner ear (injury, infection, aging) they are
                    not properly reabsorbed into the system and this
                    excess accumulation results in vertigo.</p>
                  <p>Problem within the balance center of the brain in
                    known as central vertigo.&nbsp; This is typically a
                    milder vertigo and may be accompanied by other
                    symptoms such as double vision or slurred
                    speech.&nbsp; Head trauma, neck injuries, severe
                    migraines can cause central vertigo.&nbsp; Decreased
                    blood flow to the brain (arteriosclerosis) can be
                    another cause.&nbsp;</p>
