                  <p>Unusual electrical signals in the brain cause
                    seizures.&nbsp; These occurrences can be triggered
                    by a variety of temporary conditions such as a high
                    fever, a reaction to a drug, trauma to the brain, or
                    more permanent conditions such as congenital defects
                    or aging problems.&nbsp; If the seizures do not
                    repeat after an underlying condition is corrected
                    then the seizures are not considered epilepsy.</p>
                  <p>There are a several types of seizures.&nbsp; Grand
                    mal is when the electrical abnormality affects all
                    areas of the brain.&nbsp; Partial seizures occur
                    when only part of the brain is involved and the
                    symptoms of twitching or rhythmic movements may only
                    appear in one part of the body.&nbsp; A blank stare
                    or repetitive blinking for a few seconds
                    characterizes a petit mal or absence seizure.</p>
                  <p>If someone experiences a generalized seizure (grand
                    mal) they will usually experience two phases. First
                    there is stiffening (tonic phase) then jerking
                    (clonic phase). They may appear to stop breathing,
                    they may make unusual sounds, there will be
                    thrashing of the arms and legs, the eyes will be
                    open, and they may lose urine.&nbsp; The return to
                    consciousness will be gradual within a few minutes
                    although the person will be confused for some time
                    after the seizure.</p>
                  <p>The general procedure for helping someone suffering
                    from a generalized seizure is to guard them against
                    any injury during the uncontrolled movement phase
                    but do not try to restrict their movements.&nbsp;
                    Make sure their air passage is open; usually having
                    them lay on their side is sufficient.&nbsp; If the
                    seizure lasts more than 2 minutes or a second
                    seizure starts before the person gains consciousness
                    from the first you should seek medical attention.</p>
