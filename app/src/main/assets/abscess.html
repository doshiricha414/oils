      An abscess is the result of an infection, bacterial, parasitical,
      or some type of object (sliver, etc) that causes white blood cells
      to accumulate as the body tries to protect itself.&nbsp; The
      accumulation of white blood cells and other material forms the
      milky white substance pus. This accumulation of pus with the
      associated surrounding redness forms the abscess.<br>
      An abscess can form in any part of the body but the most common
      types are skin abscesses and tooth abscesses.&nbsp; Boils and
      carbuncles are types of skin abscesses.&nbsp; Other locations such
      as the brain, liver, rectum can be more difficult to diagnose and
      to treat.&nbsp; Those with weakened immune systems may be more
      susceptible to having an abscess develop.<br>

                  <h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3>
                  <p><strong>Tooth abscess</strong></p>
                  <p>Use the Oil pulling technique 2 - 3 times daily
                    with Protective Blend or 2 drops each Clove and
                    Oregano (some may find Oregano too "hot") and 2
                    tablespoons of fractionated coconut oil. Use
                    Protective Blend toothpaste 2 times per day.
                    Continue until pain subsides plus a few days.
                    Consider 2 - 4 drops Oregano and Protective Blend in
                    a capsule daily for additional infection management.</p>
                  <p><strong>Throat abscess</strong></p>
                  <p>3 drops each Lemon, Protective Blend and Oregano in
                    mouthful of water. Gargle for 15 - 20 seconds and
                    swallow. This will be hot and not tasty so it will
                    not be satisfactory for younger children. With
                    younger children add 2 drops each Lemon and
                    Protective Blend to a spoonful of applesauce and
                    have the swallow slowly.</p>
                  <p><strong>Skin Abscess</strong></p>
                  <p>Topical application to the affected area with
                    Melaleuca, Protective Blend, Oregano, or other
                    antibacterial oils as often as every 1/2 to 1
                    hour.&nbsp; Oregano and other oils may need to be
                    diluted to lessen burning.&nbsp; Some also suggest
                    mixing Lemon with Oregano to reduce burning.</p>
                  <p><strong>Abscess, cancer, cyst, polyp or tumor?</strong></p>
                  <p>Here are some differences between terms used to
                    describe masses or lumps¬ù that may form in the
                    body.&nbsp; Common terms are abscess, cancer, cyst,
                    polyp and tumor.&nbsp;</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Tumor: a mass of tissue or abnormal cellular
                      growth. They may be cancerous (malignant), or not
                      (benign).</li>
                    <li>Cancer:&nbsp; a rapid cellular growth that may
                      spread from one part of the body to another.</li>
                    <li>Cyst: a closed sac filled with gas, liquid, or a
                      semi solid. They are usually not cancerous.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Lipoma:&nbsp; a benign growth filled with
                      apidose (fat) cells usually just beneath the skin.</li>
                    <li>Abscess:&nbsp; similar to a cyst but is filled
                      with pus.</li>
                    <li>Polyp: a tissue growth that protrudes from a
                      mucous membrane (nasal passage, cervix, colon)
                      usually benign.</li>
