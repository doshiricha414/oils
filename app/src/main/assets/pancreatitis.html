This is a small gland between the stomach and the spine on the left side of the abdomen. This places it just below the rib cage and about the midpoint of the left side. This gland is part of the digestive and the endocrine systems. It produces certain enzymes that assist in the digestion of carbohydrates, protein and fats and it also produces important hormones including insulin that helps control glucose levels. The digestive enzymes are triggered as certain types of food pass through the digestive system and are secreted into the small intestines. The hormones produced in the pancreas are passed into the circulatory system via the blood that flows through the organ.</p><p>There are two common types of pancreatitis acute and chronic. Acute pancreatitis develops suddenly and lasts a relatively short period of time. Gallstones or heavy alcohol use are the most common causes although an injury, certain medications or an infection could also be the root problem. The chronic condition can begin with acute episodes but then continues. Again alcohol abuse is a major contributor and added to the list of causes are hereditary conditions, cystic fibrosis and high triglycerides.</p><p>Symptoms include pain in the area of the pancreas itself that may be especially intense immediately after eating foods high in tat or drinking. The painful area can include the back and even to the left shoulder area. Swelling may occur and there may be nausea and vomiting. Chronic conditions that are severe enough to destroy pancreatic cells can lead to diabetes.</p><p> </p></div></div></div></div></div>
