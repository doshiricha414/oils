                  <p>Tourette’s syndrome is a neurological disorder that
                    starts in childhood and is characterized with the
                    child making uncontrolled repetitive movements or
                    sounds that are referred to as tics. These tics may
                    include actions such as jerking the arm, shrugging
                    shoulders, jumping, kicking, blinking eyes, clearing
                    throat, coughing or blurting out offensive words.</p>
                  <p>These tics usually begin at about age 7 (anywhere
                    from 2 to 12) and are more common in boys than
                    girls. Heightened emotions, excitement or anxiety,
                    can increase tics as opposed to a calm emotional
                    state where the tics subside. Tics are usually
                    diminished during rest and sleep. It is also
                    reported that some with Tourette’s Syndrome may
                    experience other neurological problems such as ADHD,
                    OCD, depression or anxiety disorders. Many
                    experience the symptoms being reduced in their late
                    teenage and early adult years and with the exception
                    of the discouragement that comes from being noticed
                    there are no know detrimental effects to health or
                    longevity from the disorder.</p>
                  <p>The reason for Tourette’s Syndrome is not yet
                    known. It is a neurological disorder that is
                    believed to be associated with the basal ganglia,
                    frontal lobes or cortex regions of the brain and the
                    neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, and
                    norepinephrine) that facilitate communication
                    between nerve cells.</p>
