    <p><span class="label1">Basil oil</span> (<span class="noLink">Basil
        CT linalool</span>) is a wonderfully sweet-smelling oil<sup></sup>,
      valued for its soothing and calming properties.&nbsp; It is
      commonly used for soothing sore muscles and joints, to assist with
      clear breathing and as a cooling agent for the skin.&nbsp;
      However, it also promotes mental alertness, sharpening mental
      focus while studying or reading, enhances memory function and
      reduces stress, tension and anxious feelings. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="label1">Basil</span> oil is steam distilled from
        the leaf of the <em class="noLink">Ocimum basilicum</em> plant.
        Unlike most basils, which contain more methylchavicol, the basil
        oil we offer is rich in linalool content (like lavender
        oil).&nbsp; This makes it very relaxing and calming, and more
        effective for reducing stress and anxious feelings.&nbsp; It
        also promotes mental alertness, enhances memory function and
        sharpens focus while studying or reading. </p>
      <p><span class="label1">Basil</span> has a warm, spicy, yet herbal
        aroma, known to enhance memory function while reducing stress
        and tension.&nbsp; It soothes sore muscles and joints, reduces
        anxious feelings and feelings of stress and tension and, when
        applied to the temples and back of the neck it reduces tension.
      </p>
      <p><span class="label1">Basil</span> is commonly used in cooking,
        to add a fresh, herbal flavor to meats, pastas and entr√©e
        dishes; but, it is also cooling to the skin, and can be used to
        soothe minor irritations.&nbsp; When diffused, <span
          class="label1">basil</span> assists with clear breathing,
        promotes mental alertness and enhances memory function, while
        sharpening focus and lessening stress.</p>
