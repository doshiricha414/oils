It can be felt just in front of the ear as you open and close your mouth. The joint has a small disc of cartilage to separate the bones and allows them to slide easily during chewing and other movements. Damage to this joint can cause pain or tenderness in the joint or in the neck, shoulders or even in the ear. Ability to open the mouth completely can be hampered, the jaw can get “stuck” open or closed. Clicking each time the mouth is opened or grinding happens with some. Secondary symptoms can include headaches, earaches, toothaches, neck aches, shoulder pains, hearing problems or tinnitis.</p><p>TMJ can be caused by an injury that damages the joint or displaces the cartilage. Arthritis in the joint can result in the TMJ symptoms. If a person grinds or clenches their teeth it can put pressure on the joint and the same with stress if a person clenches their teeth or tightens facial and jaw muscles TMJ can result. Misalignment of the bite can, over time, cause TMJ or something as simple as chewing gum too often.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/deepBlue" class="button halfsize">Soothing Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/immortelle" class="button halfsize">Anti-Aging Blend</a></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/pastTense" class="button halfsize">Tension Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/whiteFir" class="button halfsize">White Fir</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Topically apply Soothing Blend Rub or 2 - 3 drops of Frankincense or Anti-Aging Blend on the TMJ just below the ear and around to the back of the neck with light massaging motions.
