In some it develops slowly and can go undetected for years whereas with others in develops quickly and results in serious vision loss.</p><p>There are two types of AMD wet and dry.&nbsp; With both types the macula, which is the center of the retina at the back of the eye, is compromised leading to blurred vision and eventual loss of central vision.&nbsp;&nbsp; The more common type (90%) is the dry macular degeneration.&nbsp; In this case the critical light-sensitive cells in the macula region of the retina slowly die causing a slow loss of vision.&nbsp; Dry AMD can be detected before visible symptoms with a proper eye exam that can detect drusen, small yellow deposits under the retina, that are a precursor to the disease.&nbsp; Without an eye exam symptoms will begin with slightly blurred vision.</p><p>Wet AMD occurs in the same area of the retina but the deterioration is caused by blood vessels that loose fluid and lift the macula causing the vision problems.&nbsp; One early tell-tale symptom is that items that are straight lines will appear wavy.&nbsp; This condition is also known as advanced AMD and the fluid loss and resulting damage develops quickly.</p><p><strong>Glaucoma</strong></p><p>Glaucoma may cause damage to the optic nerve and result in loss of sight.&nbsp; The main body of the eye is filled with a fluid known as aqueous humor.&nbsp; This fluid is continuously being replenished near the back of the eye and drains through a channel (called the angle) near the front of the eye. &nbsp;If this drainage is impeded pressure builds in the eye and may damage the optic nerve.&nbsp; There are four types of blockage or glaucoma that may occur.&nbsp; Open-angle glaucoma is most common, it happens slowly over time and no cause is known.&nbsp; It runs in families and is more common among African-Americans. Angle-closure glaucoma is when the channel is suddenly blocked. This causes painful pressure and is an emergency situation. Congenital glaucoma occurs when the exit channel does not develop properly at birth. &nbsp;It is also hereditary.&nbsp; Secondary glaucoma can be caused by some pharmaceutical medications or as a result of an eye disease like uveitis.</p><p><strong>Retinal detachment</strong></p><p>Light travels through the cornea and lens and falls on the retina at the back of the eye.&nbsp; The retina is a thin membrane that converts the images falling on it to signals to the brain.&nbsp; If the retina becomes separated from the underlying tissue distortion in vision may occur.&nbsp; The detachment of the retina may be caused by trauma, disease such as diabetes or inflammatory disorders, or it can happen without any underlying cause.&nbsp; Symptoms of retinal detachment include blurred vision, partial lack of vision, bright flashes in peripheral vision, or floating spots in vision.</p><p><strong>Iritis/uveitis</strong></p><p>The middle layer of the eye the uvea is composed of the iris, ciliary body, and choroid.&nbsp; From the uvea comes most of the blood supply for the retina.&nbsp; Uveitis is inflammation or irritation to the uvea.&nbsp; Most commonly this occurs in the iris and is known as iritis.&nbsp; If it occurs near the back of the eye in choroid it is choroiditis.&nbsp; This condition can stem from an infection elsewhere in the body or concurrent with some autoimmune disorders.&nbsp; One or both eyes may be affected and the symptoms include redness in the eye, some pain, blurred vision, sensitivity to light, and/or floating spots in vision.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
