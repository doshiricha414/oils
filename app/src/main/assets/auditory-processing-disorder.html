This means that they could hear all the individual notes on a musical scale with equal clarity but may confuse words or sentence structure as they process complex sound. This can become more difficult for them if they are in an environment with lots of background noise. Reports suggest this problem may affect as many as 5% of school-aged children.</p><p>Examples given in the literature are that the request, "Tell me how a chair and a couch are alike," may sound to a child with APD like, "Tell me how a couch and a chair are alike." Or it can even be understood by the child as, "Tell me how a cow and a hair are alike."</p><p>Many children will “outgrow” this condition where others continue with residual difficulties. Help and therapy techniques are available.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/balance" class="button halfsize">Grounding Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemon" class="button halfsize">Lemon</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lime" class="button halfsize">Lime</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/vetiver" class="button halfsize">Vetiver</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/wildOrange" class="button halfsize">Wild Orange</a></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/peppermint" class="button halfsize">Peppermint</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>To date we have limited experiences to report protocols on.
