                  <p>Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease wherein the
                    body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy body
                    organs and tissue. With lupus this may be in the
                    joints, skin, kidneys, brain, lungs, heart or other
                    organs of the body. It occurs much more frequently
                    in women than men and more often among Asians and
                    African Americans. Medically it is not understood
                    why autoimmune diseases occur but there are many
                    that suggest candida infections and diet play a
                    role.</p>
                  <p>Because of the wide range of body systems that may
                    be attacked and the chronic inflammation that occurs
                    lupus can be mistaken for other disorders and
                    difficult to diagnose. One symptom of lupus that
                    occurs in about 50% of the instances is a rash that
                    may include the face with what is known as the
                    butterfly pattern across the cheeks and bridge of
                    the nose. The rash gets worse with sunlight and is
                    also seen on other parts of the body. Other symptoms
                    can include breathing pain, fatigue, fever, hair
                    loss, mouth sores and uneasiness. Some have no
                    visible symptoms, this is know as discoid lupus.
                    Finally if specific parts of the body are affected
                    there may be particular symptoms associated with
                    that area. The brain and nervous system and lead to
                    headaches, numbness, personality changes, seizures,
                    tingling sensations and vision problems. The
                    digestive tract can lead to pain, nausea or
                    vomiting; the heart can lead to arrhythmias; and the
                    skin can lead to the rash previously mentioned as
                    well as patchy skin color.</p>

                    supplements and 8 drops or 1 capsule of DDR Prime 2
                    times per day will definitely be beneficial. Many

                    other citrus oils in a capsule daily.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Some suggest a candida cleanse

                    For candida use the GX Assist/PB Assist protocol
                    (see Detoxification for more details). Others
                    suggest this is <span>not</span> helpful for Lupus.
                    If used consider that some with autoimmune disorders
                    are particularly sensitive and should start this
                    cleanse with 1 GX capsule daily for 2 days, if no
                    skin or digestive reactions increase to 2 capsules
