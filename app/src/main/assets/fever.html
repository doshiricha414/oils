Or place one drop Peppermint on caregiver’s hands, let the oil evaporate till moisture seems to&nbsp; disappear then rub hands on baby’s feet.</p><p>Lemon or Peppermint can be added to water with honey or agave and sipped.&nbsp; Also diffusing, cup and inhale or an inhaler can be used.</p><p>The body can also be cooled with a tepid compress prepared with 1-2 drops of Peppermint and/or Eucalyptus. Also consider preparing a tepid bath or foot bath with 1 or 2 drops of Peppermint and/or Eucalyptus or apply neat to the feet.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
