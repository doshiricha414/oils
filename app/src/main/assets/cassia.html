    <p><span class="label1">Cassia</span>, a close relative of cinnamon,
      is notable for its wonderful fragrance.&nbsp; It has been used,
      literally, for thousands of years, both for its fragrance and
      uplifting properties, and to promote healthy digestion and
      circulation, support healthy immune function and help to soothe
      sore, achy muscles. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>A close relative to cinnamon, <span class="label1">cassia</span>
        has a strong, spicy, cinnamon-like aroma that can be used in
        small quantities to transform any essential oil blend.&nbsp; It
        is steam distilled from the bark of the <em class="noLink">Cinnamomum
          cassia</em> tree. </p>
      <p><span class="label1">Cassia</span> has been used for thousands
        of years.&nbsp; It's one of the few essential oils mentioned in
        the Old Testament, noted for its unmistakable fragrance and
        uplifting properties. </p>
      <p><span class="label1">Cassia</span> is a "warming" oil, that

        function.&nbsp; When diluted, <span class="label1">cassia</span>
        can help to soothe sore, achy joints.&nbsp; It also promotes
        healthy digestion, and is a great oil to diffuse during cold
        months, due to its warming and uplifting aroma.&nbsp; It can
        also be used in cooking, either as a replacement for cinnamon,
        in pies and breads, or by itself, in a myriad of entrees and
        desserts.</p>
      <p>Due to its caustic nature, <span class="label1">cassia</span>
        should be well diluted with carrier oil, when applied to the
        skin.&nbsp; It can also be very strong, when inhaled directly. </p>
