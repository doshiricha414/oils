In many cases a cause will not be determined and this is described as essential hypertension.</p><p><strong>How Oils Can Help. </strong>Because the root cause of hypertension can be so varied or unknown it is impossible to find one protocol that addresses every situation.&nbsp; Those that have been successful have selected oils and/or blends from the following list mixing them with a <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil and consistently applied them topically at least three times a day.&nbsp; Key points for application have included the feet, the wrists, over the heart, on the carotidal arteries, and to the back of the neck and in some cases other <a href="#/tab/info/reflexology" class="button halfsize">reflexology</a> points.&nbsp;</p><p>The following is a good list of those most often mentioned:&nbsp; <strong>Cassia, Frankincense, Helichrysum, Lavender, Lemon, Marjoram, </strong>andYlang Ylang essential oils and blends of <strong>Grounding Blend, Invigorating Blend, </strong>and<strong> Calming Blend.</strong></p><p>This application of oils has been coupled with eliminating tobacco, alcohol, excessive salt and other products know to increase blood pressure.&nbsp; Further, for those most successful, habits of exercise and good diet have been added to daily routines.</p><p> </p><p>A Stage 2 Experience</p><p>The following experience from Rob James gives a great summary how he used essential oils for a Stage 2 high blood pressure experience.&nbsp;</p><p>So Am I an Expert on Hypertension?</p><p>I’m not a doctor, but I did suffer a massive hemorrhagic stroke in 2006. It nearly killed me and I’ve become very acquainted with HBP, its causes, diagnosis, and prevention ever since. My stroke was caused by moderately high blood pressure in combination with a rare condition of my adrenal gland that causes occasional spikes in blood pressure. I had such a spike in June of 2006 that shot my systolic reading to well over 200.</p><p>The question of high blood pressure and using essential oils to control it is like walking a tight wire for several reasons:</p><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High blood pressure is a serious condition.&nbsp; If you have HBP you are likely working toward future heart disease, you are probably playing Russian roulette with the possibility of stroke, and diabetes is already a concern or right around the corner.</p><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serious high blood pressure is something that you should be seeing your doctor about and my experience is that if it is elevated to a dangerous level, you need medication like Beta blockers, or Ace inhibitors.&nbsp; These can have serious side effects, but the alternative is even more dangerous.</p><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there are many different root causes, types, and conditions surrounding hypertension it is nearly impossible to identify one or more essential oil and say that “this is the oil” that can help with hypertension. In fact, I left rehabilitation with prescriptions for 8 different medications to regulate and normalize my blood pressure, and I now take just one.</p><p>I attribute my efforts to get off prescription medications to:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Weight loss and dietary changes</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Exercise</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. DoTerra’s Life Long Wellness supplements</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. No more table salt or high sodium products and a reduced use of only sea salt or whole mineral salt.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Daily use of an essential oil protocol.</p><p>I would highly recommend that any one with elevated blood pressure use all of these efforts, modifying the essential oils if necessary for their personal optimal benefit. The essential oils that I use may not be what will be best for someone else.</p><p>This still leaves many things that a person can do to help their hypertension. The dangerous thing about our society today is that many people have a lifestyle and habits that they are unwilling to change in the name of health. They would rather “take a pill” than make a change. I know people that are diabetic or borderline diabetic but still drink outrageous amount of soda pop, or diet soda pop that can raise A1c levels (A1c test indicates a person’s average blood glucose level over the past few months) even more! You must decide to make necessary changes in your life style if needed.</p><p>What I can recommend:</p><p>As a long time essential oil user, and as someone that depends on essential oils to control my hypertension I recommend:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Make dietary and exercise changes in your life that make a healthy body a priority. This may take time, for some… years. But it is by far the best step you can take towards normalized blood pressure. There are many sources that can teach you foods that are best for elevated blood pressure. Take advantage of these. If you smoke or drink alcohol, stop. It’s one of the worst things you can do for elevated blood pressure. Remove high fat, fried, high fructose corn syrup products and carbonated drinks completely from your diet.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Exercise daily. Park a few blocks from work. Get a dog and walk it daily. Go for a walk with a son, daughter or spouse every night after dinner.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Use doTerra’s Life Long Vitality supplements daily.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Use a reduced amount of quality sea salt or whole mineral salt for seasoning foods.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Find essential oils that are effective at reducing high blood pressure for YOU. This will take testing, and patience. The following has shown success.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 drops each Basil, Lavender, Marjoram in a capsule daily. Each person is different and may respond to other oils.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You need a BP cuff. You should have one anyway. As you try a new essential oil or blend, take your BP before and after in varying intervals. Try 5 min, 1 hr, 8 hrs and 16 hrs. Try applying oils hourly, every 8 hrs and every 24 hours. Keep a record of your results.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NOTE: </strong> This is a serious condition and if control is not achieved seek professional medical help.</p><p>The Oils I Use:</p><p>The following are a list of essential oils that have historically been used to help regulate high blood pressure. There are also some “blends” that some have found successful. And finally, I’ve included the blend that I personally use with success, again keeping in mind that the causes of my hypertension (adrenal) are considered rare.</p><p><strong>Single Oils</strong></p><p>Ylang Ylang</p><p>Clary Sage</p><p>Marjoram</p><p>Lavender</p><p>Helichrysum</p><p>Lemon</p><p><strong>Blends</strong></p><p>Grounding Blend</p><p>Calming Blend</p><p>Invigorating Blend</p><p> </p><p><strong>Rob’s Blend</strong></p><p>6 dropsYlang Ylang</p><p>6 drops Helichrysum</p><p>4 drops Frankincense</p><p>4 drops Marjoram</p><p>4 drops Cassia</p><p>25 drops coconut oil</p><p> </p><p>How I Apply the Oils:</p><p>Recommended applications include several drops applied with massage to the bottom of the feet, on the wrists, along the breast bone, massage over the heart, on the carotidal arteries, and to the back of the neck. Also diffusion might be effective, and adding the oil or blend to a bath (agitating the water often).</p></div></div></div></div></div>
