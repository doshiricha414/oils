Two specific protocols are given:</p><p>Varicose and Spider veins:</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;30 drops Cypress,</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;20 drops Lavender, and</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;10 drops of any of the citrus oils</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;in 2 oz coconut oil</p><p>Blend applied morning and night.&nbsp; Improvement in about a month. At that point applied daily for another 3 or 4 months to become about 10% of what they had been.</p><p>Vulvar varicosities and inflammation of veins:</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;50 drops Helichrysum</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;in 8 oz all-natural lotion base (VCO could be used)</p><p>Apply two time daily.&nbsp; Very positive results in six weeks.&nbsp; Can be combined with varicose veins protocol above.</p><p>Veins in the body can become weakened with time and unusual pressure. This can lead to them becoming enlarged and twisted oft times with visible results. Increased pressure and weakness is more common in the lower extremities and can come from aging, being overweight, during pregnancy or from continuous standing for long hours during the day. There is evidence of a heredity component as well and seems to be more prevalent among females. Also there can be a congenital defect in the valves of the veins that can lead to varicose veins.</p><p>The common mechanism that allows the veins to become twisted and enlarged is the small one-way valve that is an integral part of all veins. This valve helps the return flow of blood to the heart. If it becomes weakened for any of the reasons previously mentioned blood flow does not occur in normal fashion and blood can pool and distort the veins. If they are near the surface the visible symptoms occur.</p><p>The severity can range from a mild situation called spider veins, the more visible and protruding varicose veins and then even more serious concerns with deep vein thrombosis. Besides the visible symptoms commonly recognizable there may also be swelling, pain and itching, discoloration and skin changes. Even before visible symptoms some will experience aching or burning sensations in the legs after prolonged periods of standing or sitting. Minor injuries or cuts may in these area can lead to unusual bleeding.</p><p>Some simple preventive measures can help such as regular exercise, minimizing extended periods of standing or sitting without relief and resting with the legs elevated periodically. Mild massage with essential oils as described under the tabs above will hasten progress.</p><p> </p></div></div></div></div></div>
