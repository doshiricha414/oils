Beyond this cleansing or detoxifying the body using essential oils (see Detoxification) helps the pancreas and the digestive process.</p><p>There are a number of reports and articles of those that have made significant reduction in insulin needs with very strict diets including vegan diets.

Type 1 Diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes; Type 2 Diabetes, the most common form affecting 90 – 95% of those with diabetes; and Gestational Diabetes that occurs during pregnancy in about 4% of all pregnancies.&nbsp; Also the conditions of pre-diabetes and metabolic syndrome are related.</p><p>Type 1 Diabetes</p><p>This is an autoimmune disease.&nbsp; The body’s own immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas (beta cells) that produce insulin.&nbsp; Presently it is not known what triggers this but genetics, environment, and viral infection are all suggested.&nbsp; Once this process is triggered within 5 to 10 years all of the beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed.&nbsp; Without insulin the body does not receive the necessary fuel to the cells hence it must be supplied artificially. &nbsp;Those with Type 1 diabetes monitor their glucose levels and take shots or use an insulin pump to supplement or provide the necessary insulin.&nbsp; Those with this condition can improve their quality of life by making wise food choices with proper nutrition, keeping their body systems strong, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>Type 2 Diabetes</p><p>About 90 to 95% of those with diabetes have type 2.&nbsp; Of those that have type 2 about 80% of them are overweight but type 2 might also be associated with a family history of diabetes, older age, physical inactivity, and a history of gestational diabetes. Some ethnicities are predisposed as well, including African American, Mexican American, and those from the Pacific Islands.</p><p>In this condition the pancreas functions properly and produces insulin but the body does not utilize it properly.&nbsp; This is labeled insulin resistant.&nbsp; Type 2 symptoms usually develop slowly as the body cannot use the insulin supplied by the pancreas.&nbsp; Eventually insulin production decreases.&nbsp; Help for this condition comes from proper diet, nutrition, and physical exercise. Some essential oils are recommended for assisting the body in utilizing the glucose available in the bloodstream.</p><p>Gestational Diabetes</p><p>This type of diabetes affects a small number of women in pregnancy.&nbsp; It typically develops in the later part of a pregnancy and may even go undetected.&nbsp; It does increase the risk of other complications to mother and baby.&nbsp; After pregnancy the diabetes disappears but in 40 –60% of the cases there is a likelihood that the mother will develop type 2 diabetes in later life.</p><p>Closely associated with diabetes are:</p><p>Pre-diabetes</p><p>This is the when blood glucose levels are measured to be higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes.&nbsp; It is estimated that 1 in 4 of adults in the U.S. fall in this category.&nbsp; Those with pre-diabetes not only have a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes within 10 years but they are also at risk to have cardiovascular problems.&nbsp; These risks are reduced significantly with a 5 – 7% reduction in body weight and with improved diet, nutrition, and exercise.</p><p>Metabolic syndrome</p><p>This is the term used to describe someone with a group of risk factors for type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and stroke.&nbsp; The two most important of these risk factors are 1) obesity, particularly central obesity or extra weight around the middle of the body and 2) insulin resistance, or having the condition that the body is not able to use insulin in the proper way.</p><p>The A1C Test</p><p>For those not familiar the A1C is the scale used to measure blood glucose and how it relates to diabetic conditions.&nbsp; This is the common blood glucose test used to diagnose diabetes and help those with diabetes manage the condition.&nbsp; It is also know by the names glycated hemoglobin, glycosylated hemoglobin, hemoglobin A1C, and HbA1c.&nbsp; This test show the average blood glucose level over the last 2 or 3 months where normal home monitoring tests gives the blood sugar level at the time of the test.</p><p>Those without diabetes will be below 5% and those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes will be above 6.5 – 7% on the scale below.</p><p>&nbsp;A1C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Average Blood Glucose</p><p>&nbsp; 5 %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;95.5</p><p>&nbsp; 6 %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 125</p><p>&nbsp; 6.5 %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 139.75</p><p>&nbsp; 7 %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 154.5</p><p>&nbsp; 8 %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 184</p><p>&nbsp; 9 %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 213.5</p></div></div></div></div></div>
