Also the teeth themselves can be damaged from the physical grinding. A physical remedy to prevent teeth damage is to obtain a mouth guard from the dentist to wear during sleeping hours.</p><p>To provide long lasting help the root cause is helpful but the reasons for teeth grinding are not well documented.&nbsp; The website TeethGrindingAnswerSharing.com lists 14 possible reasons for sleep grinding:</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Anxiety or stress the person may be undergoing;</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Digestive problems;</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Asymmetrical teeth – teeth that are shaped or positioned differently on each sides of the jaw, or poor bite alignment;</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Irregular or disturbed sleep patterns – an experiment was conducted at the Nippon Dental University in Tokyo that concluded there was a positive correlation between sleep stage 1 (the first stage: drowsiness) and teeth grinding, suggesting that those with bruxism typically have unstable and shallower sleep patterns and/or sleep disorders;</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; A deficiency in pantothenic acid (Vitamin B-5). This is an anti-stress vitamin that reduces the product of certain hormones and helps control motor activity, including that of the reflexes of the jaw;</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Calcium deficiency;</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Magnesium deficiency may be another causes, as it can cause spasms and affects people at night;</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Dislocated jaw;</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Central nervous system disorders;</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Having a new dental filling installed;</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Parasites are another possible cause. A common parasite call a pinworm can cause it. A large percentage of the population has some form of parasite, so a stool analysis test may be needed to test for this;</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Ecstasy use or abuse (MDMA);</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Substances or medications cited as possible causes of teeth grinding include: Atapryl, Carbex, Catovit, Dopar, Eldenpryl, L-Denprenyl, Larodopa, Levodopa, Lodosyn, Prolintane, Selegiline, Sinemet, Sinemet CR, and Ecstasy as listed above;</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Internalization of a person’s anger can manifest itself in bruxism.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
