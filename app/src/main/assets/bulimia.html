They will then follow this with dangerous purging to rid the body of this excess. The disorder is not confined to any one racial group or gender. It is closely associated with those suffering from psychiatric disorders such as depression, OCD, substance abuse or those that have struggled with other eating disorders such as anorexia. Bulimia may be difficult to recognize, as the person may be able to maintain a normal weight or may even be overweight.</p><p>During binging or excessive eating the person will feel out of control and will eat well beyond normal consumption levels and beyond feeling physically full. Usually the large amount of food will be eaten in a short time period. Following there may be a period of satisfaction but this will be followed by guilt or distress that leads to purging. Purging can include laxatives, diuretics, enemas or self-induced vomiting to eliminate the excess food taken in during binging. There can also follow excessive exercise, dieting or fasting to compensate for the indulgence.</p><p>Signs that indicate someone is suffering from bulimia may include an obsession with weight and self image, possible evidence that large amounts of food have been consumed such as hidden food or junk food containers or wrappers, or purging signals such as signs of laxatives or self-induced vomiting, etc. Depression or other emotional signals may also be present.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/citrusBliss" class="button halfsize">Invigorating Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/grapefruit" class="button halfsize">Grapefruit</a></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/bergamot" class="button halfsize">Bergamot</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/coriander" class="button halfsize">Coriander</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/fennel" class="button halfsize">Fennel</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/ginger" class="button halfsize">Ginger</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemon" class="button halfsize">Lemon</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/oregano" class="button halfsize">Oregano</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/romanChamomile" class="button halfsize">Roman Chamomile</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Note that the oils shown above are primarily related to the eating disorder and how to encourage appetite. As many writers note the mental condition is probably of higher importance than the eating disorder and helping the person achieve emotional/mental balance will then lead to much more success using the oils that will help appetite. Seeking professional psychiatric help and coupling that with supporting essential oils may well be the best course of action. Some authors suggest using oils to help basic emotional concerns such as the following:</p><p>Soothing and calming: <span>Lavender, Calming Blend, Ylang Ylang</span></p><p>Emotionally calming that are also appetite inducing: <span>Bergamot, Invigorating Blend</span></p><p>Self esteem and self worth: <span> Grounding Blend, Joyful Blend</span></p><p>Accepting sexuality: <span>Rose, Blend for Women</span></p><p>Inhalation through diffusing or topical application is suggested as well as warm baths with the appropriate oils.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
