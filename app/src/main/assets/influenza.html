Then take the capsules internally twice daily. Start oils protocol as soon as symptoms are detected.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Gargle twice daily with 1 drop Oregano, 2 drops Protective Blend, and 2 drops Lemon in 1 or 2 tablespoons of pure water. After gargling for 5-10 minutes, swallow the mixture.</p><p>Actions to prevent spreading:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Diffuse the air that you are working, living and sleeping in. If you are suffering from symptoms, consider oils and blends that will help. If you are trying to quarantine areas of healthy air, diffuse Protective Blend.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Use Protective Blend foam cleanser to clean common use areas.</p><p>For Children:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; For children that can’t take internal treatments, use appropriate oils on their feet, chest and using the <a href="#/tab/info/massage-blend-technique" class="button halfsize">Massage Blend Technique</a></p><p>For further help<span> (those with weakened immune systems, very aggressive virus, pandemics, etc)</span>:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Oil pull daily with 1 tablespoon VCO, 2 drops Oregano, and 2 drops Melaleuca. Pull for about 10 minutes before expectorating the blend. Then brush your teeth and rinse out your mouth. This mixture may be hot. If it’s too hot, reduce the Oregano to 1 drop and add a drop of Lemon. You can also consider Cinnamon, Cassia or Protective Blend instead of Melaleuca.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Always put Lemon and Peppermint in your drinking water and drink it often. Staying hydrated is an important part of assuring the oils work effectively in our bodies.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Consider other protocols for specific symptoms. Respiratory Blend to the chest, neck and back for respiratory issues, Digestive Blend (often in a capsule with Frankincense) for nausea or digestive problems. Oregano or Cinnamon and Lemon as a gargle for sore throats.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; In cases where there is obvious inflammation to the bronchial tubes including cracking or popping sounds while breathing from the chest, consider a rectal implant. 3 drops Oregano, 3 drops Frankincense, and 3 drops Thyme in a capsule. Lubricate with virgin coconut oil then insert rectally. Al least twice daily. It is not pleasant, but highly effective and the quickest way to the lungs.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Do twice daily Massage Blend technique. Use Virgin Coconut oil as a carrier for the recommended oils. Add the blend Respiratory Blend and Thyme to Inflammatory Reduction phase.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Eat healthy mostly raw foods.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Get plenty of rest, exercise and fresh air where possible. For children that can’t take internal treatments, use appropriate oils on their feet, chest and using the spinal treatment.</p><p> </p><p>Respiratory influenza (flu) is a viral infection of the nose, throat, and lungs.&nbsp; The viruses responsible for the flu are known as Influenza A and Influenza B.&nbsp; To help understand the relationship between diseases related to, or mistaken for, the flu consider the following:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; <strong>Influenza A and B</strong> are aggressive viruses that attack the respiratory system.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; <strong>A cold</strong> is also a viral infection from one of over a hundred viruses that are less aggressive than influenza A and B but can also attack the respiratory system.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; <strong>Avian (Bird, H5N1),&nbsp; H1N1 (Swine) and H3N2</strong> are subtypes of influenza A.&nbsp; New strains evolve every few years. See a more detailed description at the end of this page.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; <strong>The stomach flu</strong> is also a viral infection but it attacks the stomach and intestines.&nbsp; These viruses are of different strains than cold or influenza A and B viruses.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; <strong>Flu and colds</strong> are viral not bacterial.&nbsp; Antibiotics will not help.</p><p><strong>Flu symptoms</strong></p><p>One to four days after the virus enters the body symptoms will begin.&nbsp; Typically a high fever from 102 to 106 °F (higher temperatures usually for children) is the first symptom.&nbsp; This will be followed by overall aches, headaches, chills, dizziness, and lack of energy.&nbsp; Some will experience nausea and vomiting.&nbsp; This can last 2 or 3 days and then symptoms may move to cold like symptoms of a runny nose, coughing, sneezing, and sore throat. For those severely weakened pneumonia is a danger.&nbsp; For others the tiredness and lack of energy can last for weeks.</p><p><strong>Flu and cold differences</strong></p><p>Symptoms for a cold and the flu may be similar.&nbsp; A cold is much more common and less dangerous.&nbsp; Some differences and similarities are:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; The flu hits harder and faster.&nbsp; Symptoms develop rapidly and are very strong.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; For adults a fever usually means the flu.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; If it lasts for weeks it was the flu.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Headaches, coughs, earaches happen with both.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Early sore throat or runny nose it is probably a cold.</p><p>How the flu is spread</p><p>The flu is a highly contagious disease that can be transmitted by coughs, sneezing or other contact with someone that is contagious.&nbsp; This can occur from one day before someone shows symptoms to three to seven days after.&nbsp; This is further complicated since some can have the virus but not show any symptoms.</p><p><strong>Influenza A or B</strong></p><p>Influenza A is usually more aggressive and arrives between early winter and early spring.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Influenza B can appear at any time of the year.</p><p><strong>Stomach flu (viral gastroenteritis)</strong></p><p>This is a viral infection of the stomach and intestines that often lead to diarrhea and vomiting in children and adults.&nbsp; The virus may come from contaminated food or water or can be spread from person to person.&nbsp; Beyond stomach discomforts symptoms may include chills, sweats, muscle and joint aches, and fever.</p><p> </p><p><strong>West Nile, Swine/H1N1, Bird and H3N2 Flu</strong></p><p>Here are some comments from the CDC (Center of Disease Control) on the most recent world wide flu scares:</p><p>West Nile virus</p><p>West Nile virus (WNV) is a potentially serious illness. Experts believe WNV is established as a seasonal epidemic in North America that flares up in the summer and continues into the fall.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; What Can I Do to Prevent WNV?&nbsp; The easiest and best way to avoid WNV is to prevent mosquito bites.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; What Are the Symptoms of WNV?</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serious Symptoms in a Few People. About one in 150 people infected with WNV will develop severe illness. The severe symptoms can include high fever, headache, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, vision loss, numbness and paralysis. These symptoms may last several weeks, and neurological effects may be permanent.</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Milder Symptoms in Some People. Up to 20 percent of the people who become infected have symptoms such as fever, headache, and body aches, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes swollen lymph glands or a skin rash on the chest, stomach and back. Symptoms can last for as short as a few days, though even healthy people have become sick for several weeks.</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Symptoms in Most People. Approximately 80 percent of people (about 4 out of 5) who are infected with WNV will not show any symptoms at all.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; How Does West Nile Virus Spread? Most often, WNV is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds. WNV is not spread through casual contact such as touching or kissing a person with the virus.</p><p><strong>Avian flu (bird flu)</strong></p><p>Usually, “avian influenza virus” refers to influenza A viruses found chiefly in birds, but infections with these viruses can occur in humans. The risk from avian influenza is generally low to most people, because the viruses do not usually infect humans.</p><p>"Human influenza A viruses" usually refers to those influenza A subtypes that have spread widely among humans. Currently, H3N2 and H1N1 influenza A subtypes are circulating among humans and H2N2 influenza A circulated from about 1957-1968.</p><p>Some genetic parts of current human influenza A viruses had their origin in bird flu viruses originally. Influenza A viruses are constantly changing, and they might adapt over time to infect and spread among humans.</p><p><strong>Swine Flu (H1N1)</strong></p><p>U.S.The U.S. Public Health Emergency for 2009 H1N1 Influenza expired on June 23, 2010. On August 10, 2010, the World Health Organization … Emergency Committee declared an end to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic globally. …&nbsp; Internationally, 2009 H1N1 viruses and seasonal influenza viruses are co-circulating in many parts of the world.&nbsp; It is likely that the 2009 H1N1 virus will continue to spread for years to come, like a regular seasonal influenza virus.</p><p><strong>H3N2</strong></p><p>This strain has was moderately present in 2011/12&nbsp; and now (Jan 2013) has been declared an epidemic in the US. The public flu vaccine is said to be effective and is advised for all ages but there are record number of cases at this time. The normal recommendations of lots of rest, stay hydrated and "over the counter drugs for symptoms" is the professional medical advice. Expect a week long recovery and if it extends beyond this seek professional help.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
