      <p><span class="label1">Insect Repellent Blend</span> combines a
        proprietary blend of highly effective and safe essential oils,
        in a base of fractionated coconut oil, to help ward off
        insects.&nbsp; A primary function of essential oils in plants is
        protecting against insects and other predators.&nbsp; But,
        unlike other products, that contain synthetic and toxic
        chemicals, <span class="label1">Insect Repellent Blend</span>
        is a natural approach to managing exposure to biting insects. </p>

          virginiana</em>) (1.5%), and a blend of 11 other
        therapeutic-grade essential oils, blended in a base of pure
        fractionated coconut oil.&nbsp; These include <span
          class="noLink"><em>Skimmia laureola</em></span>, <span
          class="noLink">catnip</span> (<span class="noLink"><em>Nepeta
            cataria</em></span>), <span class="noLink">amyris</span> (<span
          class="noLink"><em>Amyris balsamifera</em></span>), <span
          class="noLink">African sandalwood</span> (<span class="noLink"><em>Brachyleana
            hutchinsii</em></span>), <span class="noLink">Cabrueva
          balsam</span> (<span class="noLink"><em>Myrocarpus fastigiatus</em></span>),
        wild orange (<em>Citrus sinensis</em>), white fir (<em>Abies
          alba</em>), eucalyptus (<em>E. radiata</em>), Hawaiian
        sandalwood (<em>Santalum paniculatum</em>), <span
          class="noLink">genet</span> (<span class="noLink"><em>Spartium
            junceum</em></span>) and <span class="noLink">rose</span> (<span
          class="noLink"><em>Rosa damascena</em></span>) oils.&nbsp;
        These oils have been scientifically shown to repel insects more
        effectively than other insect repellents. </p>
      <p><span class="label1">Insect Repellent Blend</span> also smells
        <em>great</em>, with a fresh, light, citrusy scent, and is
        wonderfully invigorating.&nbsp; It goes on smoothly and is
        absorbed quickly.</p>
