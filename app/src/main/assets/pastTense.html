      <p>Life in the modern world can leave a person feeling stressed,
        tense and out-of-sorts.&nbsp; If this is ignored, it can lead to
        compromised health. <span class="label1">Tension Blend </span>is
        a distinctive blend of nine&nbsp; essential oils, known for
        their soothing effects on both the mind and body.&nbsp; These
        oils quickly ease muscle tension, in the neck and head, and calm
        emotions, to reduce the discomforts associated with tension and
        stress. </p>
      <p>Expertly crafted from the&nbsp; essential oils of wintergreen (<em>Gaultheria
          procumbens</em>), lavender (<em>Lavandula angustifolia</em>),
        peppermint (<em>Mentha piperita</em>), frankincense (<em>Boswellia
          carterii</em>), cilantro (<em>Coriandrum sativum</em>),
        marjoram (<em>Origanum majorana</em>), Roman chamomile (<em>Anthemis
          nobilis</em>), basil (<em>Ocimum basilicum</em>) and rosemary
        (<em>Rosmarinus officinalis</em>), <span class="label1">Tension
          Blend</span> has fresh, minty, herbal scent, that provides
        powerful, calming comfort for those times when life gets the
        better of you. </p>

      <h3>How to use</h3>
      <p><span class="label1">Tension Blend</span> can be used
        aromatically or topically.&nbsp; It is mild enough to be used
        neat.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="label1">Topical use:</span> Apply to desired
          area.&nbsp; I feel that it's best to apply to the temples and
          back of neck; although I've enjoyed applying it to the bald
          spot, on the top of my head.&nbsp; It has a cooling,
          invigorating sensation that I love.&nbsp; While <span
            class="label1">Tension Blend</span> is gentle enough to use
          neat, dilution with carrier oil will minimize any possible
          skin sensitivity.&nbsp; See additional precautions below. </li>
        <li><span class="label1">Aromatic use:</span> <span
            class="label1">Tension Blend</span> can be diffused or
          inhaled.&nbsp; But, any topical application will provide you
          with a great aromatic experience, as well. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="label1">Cautions:</span> Possible skin
        sensitivity.&nbsp; Keep out of reach of children.&nbsp; If you
        are pregnant, nursing, or under a doctor's care, consult your
        physician.&nbsp; Avoid contact with eyes, inner ears and
        sensitive areas. </p>
