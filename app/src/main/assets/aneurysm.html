These may be small and slow in developing with no noticeable symptoms or larger, faster developing requiring immediate emergency medical intervention with a risk of death. The most common locations for aneurysms are in the aorta, which is the major artery from the left ventricle of the heart or a cerebral aneurysm, which is the widening of an artery in the brain. The aortic aneurysm is described as thoracic if it occurs in the upper aorta and abdominal if it occurs in the lower aorta.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Other aneurysms include a popliteal aneurysm which is the artery on the back side of the knee, a mesenteric aneurysm which is associated with the intestines or a splenic aneurysm in the artery of the spleen. Symptoms will vary depending on the size and location of the aneurysm. Some aneurysms are so small that they can go undetected for years. If the aneurysm is larger and close to the surface of the skin a lump may be felt with a pulsing that is in synchronism with the heartbeat.&nbsp; Abdominal aorta aneurysms may cause a throbbing in the abdomen along with some pain or the pain can move to or be in the back. A cerebral aneurysm can cause a rapidly developing headache, confusion, nausea, eye problems or even seizures or loss of consciousness. As mentioned previously rapidly developing and large aneurysms are life threatening and should receive immediate medical attention.</p><p>Â </p></div></div></div></div></div>
