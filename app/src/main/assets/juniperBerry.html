    <p><span class="label1">Juniper berry</span> has a rich history of
      traditional uses. It acts as a natural cleansing and detoxifying
      agent, both internally and externally, and supports healthy kidney
      and urinary function. It may benefit problematic skin areas, and
      helps to relieve tension and stress. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="label1">Juniper berry</span> oil is derived from
        the <em>berries</em> of the coniferous <span class="noLink"><em>Juniperus

            communis</em></span> tree, which are steam distilled, and
        yields an essential oil with a balsamic, clean, woody, spicy
        aroma, which is high in the chemical constituents of <span
          class="noLink">α-pinene</span>, <span class="noLink">sabinene</span>.
        The scent has a calming effect, that helps relieve tension and
        stress. When diffused, <span class="label1">juniper berry</span>
        helps to cleanse and purify the air. </p>
      <p>It should be noted that other essential oil companies typically
        offer an oil that is distilled from the branches and berries of
        the <span class="noLink"><em>Juniperus communis</em></span>
        tree. This produces an oil with a very different chemical
        profile and therapeutic benefits. </p>
