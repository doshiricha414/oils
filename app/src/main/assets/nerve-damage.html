                      protocols:</strong></h3>
                  <p>Nerve damage can come from a variety of
                    sources.&nbsp; If uncertain consider the
                    possibilities of viral or bacterial infection,
                    muscle spasms or cramps, local inflammation, or
                    other root causes and use oils recommended for these
                    concerns.&nbsp; For repair and regeneration of nerve
                    tissue Frankincense, Helichrysum, and Roman
                    Chamomile are most often suggested. More complex
                    protocols also increase blood circulation to hasten
                    healing and may have oils for pain management.&nbsp;
                    Below are three protocols suggested:</p>
                  <p>Restore damaged nerve tissue:</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Apply 1 - 2 drops of
                    Frankincense and/or Helichrysum to the affected area
                    2 to 3 times daily to restore .</p>
                  <p>Restore damaged nerves, including increased
                    circulation:</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;5 parts - Helichrysum</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;3 parts - Cypress</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;8 parts - Geranium</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2 parts - Juniper</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;part - Peppermint</p>
                  <p>3-4 drops topically to the area of damage 2-3 times
                    per day.</p>
                  <p>Restore damaged nerves, increased circulation, pain
                    management, and infection protection:</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;15 drops Geranium</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;10 Helichrysum</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;10 Wintergreen</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;8 Marjoram</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;6 Cypress</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;5 Peppermint</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Clove</p>
                  <p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Lemon</p>
                  <p>3-4 drops topically&nbsp;to the area of damage 2-3
                    times per day.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>The nervous system has three primary functions. The
                    Sensory System gathers information about the
                    environment around the body and transmits it to the
                    brain.&nbsp; This would include touch, taste, or any
                    of the five senses.&nbsp; The Motor Nerves (Somatic)
                    control the voluntary movements of the body such as
                    walking or talking. The Autonomic Nerves control the
                    involuntary actions of the body such as heartbeat,
                    digestion, or adrenal release. (The tab above,
                    Nervous System, gives a more detailed description of
                    the complete nervous system.)</p>
                  <p>Because of the complexity of this body system there
                    are many possible problems that may occur with a
                    myriad of symptoms.&nbsp; These can range from the
                    nuisance of having numbness in the end of a finger
                    to a disabling injury to the spine.&nbsp; Nerve
                    damage may be the result of, or a symptom of, a
                    number of diseases.&nbsp; Listed below are some
                    common conditions involving nerve damage:</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Autoimmune diseases such as
                    inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, and multiple
                    sclerosis.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Cancer growth can caused
                    direct damage to nerve tissue or enlarged tumors can
                    apply pressure on nerve tissue.&nbsp; Beyond there
                    may be collateral damage to nerve tissue from the
                    cancer treatments of radiation and chemotherapy.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Diabetes often includes damage
                    to sensory nerves resulting in diabetic neuropathy.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Infections of different types
                    such as HIV, hepatitis C, and Lyme disease affect
                    the nerves.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Medicines, drugs, or toxins
                    can damage nerve tissue.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Motor neuron diseases such a
                    ALS or Lou Gehrig’s diseases affect neurons
                    directly.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Pressure from arthritic growth
                    or other abnormalities often constricts nerve
                    passageways or puts pressure on nerve tissue
                    resulting in pain and discomfort.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Trauma to any part of the body
                    can result in damage to sensory, motor, or autonomic
                    neurons or their pathways.</p>
                  <p>Symptoms will vary depending on which part of the
                    nervous system is damaged:</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Autonomic nerve damage may
                    include bladder problems, constipation, dry eyes,
                    dry mouth, excessive perspiration, or sexual
                    dysfunction.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Motor nerve damage may produce
                    muscle atrophy, paralysis, twitching, or weakness.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Sensory nerve damage can
                    result in burning, dizziness, numbness, pain, or
                    tingling.</p>
