                  <p>Menopause is the natural rebalancing of hormones in
                    a woman’s body as she transitions to the
                    after-child-bearing years. This period varies from
                    individual to individual starting as early as the
                    mid 40s to as late as the mid 50s. The technical
                    definition of menopause is the point in a woman’s
                    life when she has not had a menstrual period for 1
                    year. Perimenopause (pre-menopause) is a period of 2
                    to 8 years that leads to menopause. During this
                    transition there can be a variety of symptoms from
                    the common hot flash to physical and emotional
                    concerns. The changes themselves all stem from the
                    hormonal rebalancing that naturally occurs in the
                    body at this time.</p>
                  <p>Dr. David Hill in a 2010 lecture gives this great
                    summary description of menopause followed by a 2012
                    webinar video on Women's Health and Hormones:</p>
                  <p>Menopause can be initiated in three ways.</p>

                    Natural Menopause - Natural Menopause should be
                    regarded as a normal adjustment reflecting a benign
                    change in a women’s biological life from child
                    bearing to a new period of personal fulfillment.</p>

                    Premature Menopause (Toxicity Induced) - May be

                  <p>note:&nbsp; Many modern products in our industrial
                    society have xenoestrogen components and our bodies
                    need to be strengthened against them. <span> <span><em>(Xenoestrogens</em>
                        are manmade chemicals which mimic natural

                    Artificial Menopause (Surgical Inducement) -
                    Surgical removal of the uterus deprives the body of
                    ovarian produced hormones needed during and after
                    menopause resulting in poor:</p>

                    dominance (estrogen/progesterone balance) resulting
