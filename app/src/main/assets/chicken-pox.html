                  <p>Chicken Pox is a common childhood disease typical
                    among pre-teenage children.&nbsp; It is a highly
                    contagious infection of a virus known as varicella
                    zoster.&nbsp; The symptoms start as flu-like
                    discomforts such as a fever, muscle or stomach pain,
                    fatigue, and possibly headaches.&nbsp; This is
                    followed in 1 to 4 days with a rash of small reddish
                    spots that can be anywhere on the body and are
                    usually uncomfortably itchy.&nbsp; The spots can
                    blister and the open sores can have the added
                    complication of a bacterial infection.&nbsp; Because
                    the virus is highly contagious the child should stay
                    at home and those exposed should use antiviral
                    essential oils to prevent also acquiring it.</p>
                  <p>The flu-like symptoms and itchy spots can cause
                    discomfort but the illness is typically mild and
                    over in a few days to a week.&nbsp; Older children
                    will be affected more and those with weak immune
                    systems may have difficulty as well.&nbsp;
                    Unfortunately, those that have had chicken pox or
                    the vaccine run the risk that the virus will remain
                    dormant in the nerve cells near the spine and in
                    later life can become active as <a class="button

                  <p><strong>Itching.</strong>&nbsp; To relieve the
                    symptoms of itching salves can be made using
                    essential oils or products and home remedies may be
                    enhanced with essential oils:</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span>路</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    A&nbsp;salve&nbsp;of Lavender (itching) and
                    Melaleuca (prevent bacterial infection) can be made
                    and topically applied as often as necessary to the
                    itchy spots.</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span>路</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    A salve using Calamine lotion with Lavender and
                    Melaleuca added may be applied topically as
                    well.&nbsp; Use 3 drops of each oil for each ounce
                    of Calamine lotion.</p>
                  <p>For those with extensive spots baths may be more
                    effective to relieve itching.&nbsp; A number of home
                    remedies have been suggested and may be augmented
                    with Lavender essential oil:</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span>路</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Oatmeal/Lavender
                      bath.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Place two cups of
                    cooked oatmeal in a closed cotton bag and place in a
                    warm bathtub of water.&nbsp; Add 2 to 4 drops of
                    Lavender and mix well.&nbsp; A small child can then
                    soak/play while getting relief.</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span>路</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Baking
                      soda/Lavender bath.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Add 1 cup
                    of baking soda and 2 to 4 drops of Lavender to a
                    warm bathtub of water.&nbsp; Mix well and a small
                    child can soak/play while getting relief.</p>
                  <p><strong>Contagion:</strong>&nbsp; Using antiviral
                    precautions with Protective Blend products around
                    someone with chicken pox can reduce the danger of
                    passing it on to others, especially if they are in
                    contact with someone with a weakened immune system
                    that could be severely impacted.&nbsp; Consider
                    diffusing, and using hand wipes.</p>
                  <p><strong>Flu-like symptoms:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;A
                    tea using 2-3 drops of Lemon oil and honey in a cup
                    of warm water will provide calming relief.&nbsp; To
                    relieve further symptoms of headache or fever use
                    the essential oils techniques described under those
                    health concerns.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Do not use aspirin to
                    reduce fever. Children should never be given aspirin
                    or medications containing aspirin for chicken pox or
                    any other viral illness because of the risk of
                    Reye's syndrome.&nbsp; This is a disorder that
                    causes sudden and dangerous liver and brain damage.
                    It is a very rare but of such severe complications
                    caution must be taken.</p>
