It is highly contagious especially as the fluid starts to form and ooze.&nbsp; As children scratch or rub the area they can easily transport it to other areas of their body.&nbsp; It can also be carried to others by using common items like towels, bedding, furniture, or toys.</p><p>Ecthyma is a stage more serious than impetigo which is an infection of the epidermal layer of the skin.&nbsp; When it is left unattended the infection can worsen and penetrate into the dermal layer of the skin.&nbsp; This then is ecthyma and is a much more serious condition.&nbsp; The pus-filled sores and the inflamed area becomes larger and the crusty scabs are darker and thicker than with impetigo.&nbsp; The larger area is itchy and there is a much higher probability that the infection will spread.&nbsp; Also because of the deeper penetration the risk of scarring is much higher than with impetigo.</p><p><strong>Helpful background information:</strong></p><p>Your skin, the protection between you and the outer world, is your body’s largest organ.&nbsp; It is there to protect you from infectious agents, environmental extremes, bumps, scratches, or invasive objects.&nbsp; It has a system of nerves to warn against impending dangers, a system of sweat glands for cooling, a capillary system that can bring nutritional helps to the blood stream, and a system to exude poisons from the body.&nbsp; A marvelous gland and so important for our health and well-being.</p><p>The skin is made up of three layers:</p><p>The epidermis – This is the outer layer of the skin.&nbsp; It the primary protective coating of the body and is primarily non-living cells (no blood is delivered to them) that are fed by the lower dermis layer.&nbsp; The epidermis is continually being rejuvenated from the dermis with the outer layer being completely replaced every 3 to 5 weeks.</p><p>The dermis – This layer, immediately below the epidermis, has all of the working elements of the skin.&nbsp; It has the outermost capillaries of the blood system, it is the location of the sweat glands, it includes lymph nodes housing immune system cells, it has nerve endings for our sense of touch, and the hair follicles.&nbsp; Around the hair follicles are the sebaceous glands that produce sebum.&nbsp; The proper amount of sebum, an oily secretion, lubricates and waterproofs our skin.&nbsp; Too much sebum, common to adolescents, leads to acne.&nbsp; Too little sebum, common to aging adults, leads to dry skin that promotes wrinkles. <em>Interestingly enough this same sebum is also a very important element in the use of essential oils.&nbsp; This fatty substance is nearly ideal for absorbing essential oils, which then allows them, if applied topically (directly on the skin) to quickly enter the bloodstream.&nbsp; A demonstration by Dr. David Hill shows the effects of oils in the blood stream within a matter of tens of seconds.</em></p><p>The subcutaneous (hypodermal) layer – This is the innermost layer of the skin.&nbsp; It is the insulation for the body and is composed mostly of fat cell (adipocytes).&nbsp; Besides insulation these fat cells provide texture for a pleasing appearance of the skin.&nbsp; As these fat cells are lost, often in aging, wrinkles appear and sagging occurs.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
