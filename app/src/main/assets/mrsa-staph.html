                    capsule and take 2 - 3 times a day for 2 weeks. If
                    Protective Blend is not available blend 4 drops of
                    Oregano, 4 drops of Melaleuca and a drop of
                    Frankincense in a capsule and take 2 - 3 times
                    daily.</p>
                  <p>Consider running a diffuser in the room with 2
                    drops each of Protective Blend and Oregano where
                    anyone might be exposed.</p>
                  <p><strong>Open sores: </strong>Apply topically
                    Frankincense or layer Anti-Aging Blend, Protective
                    Blend, Oregano and Frankincense. Apply cautiously to
                    avoid cross contamination to other areas or other
                    people. A <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil can also be considered for

                  <p>MRSA</p>
                  <p>Many discussions now center around
                    Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus&nbsp; or
                    MRSA.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following discusses this most
                    common of hospital acquired infections and a
                    significant cause of death.A common misconception is
                    that MRSA is a virus or caused by virus. &nbsp;In
                    fact you will probably still find some argument
                    about it. &nbsp;But my understanding is that MRSA is
                    not caused by a virus. Instead, MRSA is a strain of
                    the bacteria Staphylococcus aureas. MRSA even got
                    its name because it is a bacteria that is resistant
                    to the antibiotic methicillin. It has since become
                    resistant to almost all types of antibiotics.
                    &nbsp;If you get MRSA, and a hospital is treating
                    it, it almost become a game of cat and mouse as they
                    determine what antibiotic might be most effective in
                    your body vs. dealing with horrific side effects and
                    allergic reactions - or in other words, your body
                    saying; WAIT! &nbsp;What the he#% is that!!</p>
                  <p>New strains of MRSA have recently emerged in the
                    community that are capable of causing severe
                    infections in otherwise healthy individuals. These
                    MRSA infections are known as CAMRSA or
                    community-associated MRSA. MRSA infections that are
                    acquired in the hospitals and healthcare facilities
                    are known as healthcare-associated MRSA.</p>
                  <p>Depending on where you get your statistics from.
                    &nbsp;If you get MRSA during a hospital stay, you
                    have about a 5-10% chance of dying. MRSA now kills
                    more people than the aids virus. <br>
