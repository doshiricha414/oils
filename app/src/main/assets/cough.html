                        oils that relax reactive muscles, and tissues,
                        and in this case, suppressing the cough is
                        usually good. &nbsp;Ie. Frankincense, Clove,
                        Eucalyptus, Myrrh, Rosemary, Ylang Ylang.
                        &nbsp;Use topically near the affected area.
                        Gargle for irritation to throat, or use
                        internally in a capsule for lungs. (3x or more
                        daily). Diffuse Frankincense and Rosemary at
                        night. Diffuse Eucalyptus or Rosemary,
                        especially at night. A tea with any of these
                        oils may prove helpful. &nbsp;Experiment as
