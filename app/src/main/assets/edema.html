If no known reason for the swelling is identified it is referred to as idiopathic edema.</p><p>Edema, Lymphedema, and Lipedema</p><p><span>Edema</span> is caused by excessive fluids from the circulatory system accumulating in the tissues of the body.&nbsp; This may be the body’s normal response to an injury that causes temporary swelling or a problem with the heart or circulatory system that results in longer term swelling.&nbsp; If the swollen area is pressed with the finger and removed the mark will soon disappear.&nbsp; This is known as nonpitting edema.&nbsp; A diuretic may help nonpitting edema.</p><p><span>Lymphedema</span> is caused by excessive lymphatic fluids in an area of the body.&nbsp; This is usually because the lymphatic system is impaired and unable to handle the amount of fluid present thus causing swelling.&nbsp; These areas may be subject to infection or slow healing.&nbsp; In the early stages if the swollen area is pressed with the finger and removed a mark will remain for an extended period of time.&nbsp; This is known as pitting edema.&nbsp; Lymphedema will not respond to a diuretic.</p><p><span>Lipedema</span> affects primarily women and may be associated with genetics and hormones.&nbsp; The symptoms are enlarged legs and buttocks as fat is abnormally deposited in the layer below the skin.&nbsp; These fat accumulations do to not respond directly to normal dieting and exercise.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
