                  <p>Suggested protocols:</p>
                  <p>Depression seems to be an epidemic in today’s
                    society. Essential oils can help. For mild
                    depression Lavender, Sandalwood, and Ylang Ylang
                    among others, are effective. Also the blends
                    Grounding Blend, Joyful Blend, and Calming Blend are
                    very effective.</p>
                  <p>A special blend using Melissa is suggested by Dr.
                    Hill:</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 2-3 drops Wild Orange</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 2-3 drops Peppermint</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 2-3 drops Melissa</p>
                  <p>Also highly recommended is consistent use of the
                    Life Long Vitality supplements.</p>
                  <p><strong>Application: </strong>Diffusion is most
                    effective, but topical application to the chest or
                    body and foot massages or baths also offer good
                    results. Use cup and inhale after applying topically
                    or consider having an inhaler handy if you are on
                    the go. Since&nbsp; there are a wide variety of oils
                    that potentially can help experiment as necessary to
                    find out what oils offer optimum results for each
                    individual. Some point out that if help is required
                    over a long period of time a single oil or blend can
                    get “boring” or less effective. For best results
                    rotate or change oils or blends periodically.</p>
                  <p><strong>Safety Precautions:</strong> If severe
                    states of depression persist, the help of a
                    qualified licensed professional is recommended.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>In March 2006, the Washington Post ran an article
                    from a $35 million dollar government-funded study on
                    depression drugs with these facts: “Antidepressants
                    fail to cure the symptoms of major depression in
                    half of all patients with the disease even if they
                    receive the best possible care” according to a
                    definitive government study.</p>
                  <p>Depression is commonly used to describe the
                    feelings of sadness, disappointment, helplessness,
                    etc. that come with many of life’s experiences at
                    times of loss or tragedy, personal or family
                    difficulties, or unexpected changes in
                    relationships, finances, or health.&nbsp; These may
                    be feeling that last a few days or can extend into
                    years for some folks.&nbsp; Everyone experiences
                    these feelings at some time in life but beyond this
                    there is a clinical definition of depression used by
                    medical professionals.&nbsp; The term used most
                    often is “clinical depression”.&nbsp; MayoClinic.com
                    describes clinical depression in this way:</p>
                  <p><strong>Clinical depression&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
                  <p>&nbsp;Clinical depression symptoms may include:</p>
                  <p>Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day</p>
                  <p>Loss of interest or pleasure in most activities</p>
                  <p>Significant weight loss or gain</p>
                  <p>Sleeping too much or not being able to sleep nearly
                    every day</p>
                  <p>Slowed thinking or movement that others can see</p>
                  <p>Fatigue or low energy nearly every day</p>
                  <p>Feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt</p>
                  <p>Loss of concentration or indecisiveness</p>
                  <p>Recurring thoughts of death or suicide</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;To meet the criteria for clinical depression
                    (called major depression in the DSM), you must have
                    five or more of the above symptoms over a two-week
                    period. At least one of the symptoms must be either
                    a depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure.
                    Keep in mind, some types of depression may not fit
                    this strict definition.</p>
                  <p>Clinical depression causes noticeable disruptions
                    in daily life, such as work, school or social
                    activities. It can affect people of any age or sex,
                    including children. It isn't the same as depression
                    caused by a loss (such as the death of a loved one),
                    substance abuse or a medical condition such as a
                    thyroid disorder.</p>
                  <p><strong>Depression and suicide</strong></p>
                  <p>An important consideration with severe depression
                    is suicide. <br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Depression is a major risk factor for suicide. The
                    deep despair and hopelessness that goes along with
                    depression can make suicide feel like the only way
                    to escape the pain. Thoughts of death or suicide are
                    a serious symptom of depression, so take any
                    suicidal talk or behavior seriously. It's not just a
                    warning sign that the person is thinking about
                    suicide: it's a cry for help.</p>
                  <p>Warning signs of suicide include:</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking
                    about killing or harming one’s self</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expressing
                    strong feelings of hopelessness or being trapped</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An
                    unusual preoccupation with death or dying</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acting
                    recklessly, as if they have a death wish (e.g.
                    speeding through red lights)</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling
                    or visiting people to say goodbye</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting
                    affairs in order (giving away prized possessions,
                    tying up loose ends)</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying
                    things like “Everyone would be better off without
                    me” or “I want out.”</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
                    sudden switch from being extremely depressed to
                    acting calm and happy.</p>
                  <p>If you think a friend or family member is
                    considering suicide, express your concern and seek
                    professional help immediately. Talking openly about
                    suicidal thoughts and feelings can save a life.</p>
