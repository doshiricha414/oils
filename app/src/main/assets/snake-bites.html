The common venomous snakes are the rattlesnake, copperhead, water moccasin and coral snake. Bites from any of these snakes should be taken very seriously and emergency medical treatment should be the highest priority. If bitten and the snake can be clearly identified or without risk killed and acquired that information will be helpful during medical treatment using an antivenom. If perchance there is a bite from a nonpoisonous snake it can be treated as a puncture wound from any other animal.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/balance" class="button halfsize">Grounding Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/basil" class="button halfsize">Basil</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/helichrysum" class="button halfsize">Helichrysum</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/teaTree" class="button halfsize">Melaleuca</a></p><p><strong>Also consider: </strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/cinnamon" class="button halfsize">Cinnamon</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/citrusBliss" class="button halfsize">Invigorating Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemon" class="button halfsize">Lemon</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/thyme" class="button halfsize">Thyme</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Couple oils with emergency medical attention.
