                  <p><strong>Reducing Chronic Stress:&nbsp;</strong></p>
                  <p>Chronic stress produces two negative effects on
                    hormonal balance.&nbsp; Progesterone is converted to
                    cortisol and adrenaline inhibits the proper
                    interaction of progesterone within cells.&nbsp; Both
                    of these lead to estrogen dominance and the
                    resulting symptoms.</p>
                  <p>Stress reducing oils and blends presented were:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Citrus oils, Ylang Ylang, Roman Chamomile,
                      Calming Blend, Grounding Blend, Joyful Blend,
                      Frankincense, Lavender, Patchouli, Rose</li>
                    <li>Sandalwood in combination with Bergamot, Roman
                      Chamomile, and Frankincense that mixed together
                      give a very pleasing aroma.&nbsp; Using 1 drop of
                      each mixed together he would apply to the bottoms
                      of the feet, the back of the neck, the temples
                      and/or inhale the aroma.&nbsp; <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>Finally, a must for those dealing with hormonal
                      balance are the oils, blends, and procedures in
                      the <a href="#/tab/info/massage-blend-technique" class="button halfsize">Massage Blend Technique</a>.&nbsp; This should be
                      done on a consistent and regular basis once a
                      week, twice a month at the least, and more often
                      if needed.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Each person has two adrenal glands, one on the top
                    of each kidney.&nbsp; These small glands secrete a
                    number of hormones that are critical to our
                    well-being.&nbsp; Adrenaline affects blood pressure,
                    heart rate, and sweating; mineralocorticoids affect
                    blood pressure plus the levels of salts and
                    potassium in the body.&nbsp; Other hormones control
                    how fats, proteins, and carbohydrates are used plus
                    male sex functions.&nbsp; Cortisol is also produced
                    by the adrenal glands and has a number of important
                    functions including helping the body deal with
                    stress.</p>
                  <p>Adrenal disorders include diseases or conditions
                    where there is adrenal insufficiency and also over
                    production.&nbsp; <strong>Adrenal insufficiency</strong>
                    is the term used in allopathic (traditional western)
                    medicine to describe conditions wherein the adrenal
                    glands do not produce sufficient hormones.&nbsp;
                    Addison’s disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia
                    are diseases that may lead to adrenal
                    insufficiency.&nbsp; Other disorders can lead to an
                    excess of hormones.&nbsp; Cushing’s syndrome is one
                    such disorder.&nbsp; There are also other rare
                    disorders including a form of cancer that fall in
                    this category.&nbsp; Beyond this tumor, nearby
                    infections, and trauma can affect hormone
                    production.</p>
                  <p><strong>Adrenal fatigue</strong> (hypoadrenia) is a
                    term used in alternative medicine for a syndrome or
                    a group of symptoms that are the result of the
                    adrenal glands functioning below their normal and
                    needed levels.&nbsp; (Traditional, allopathic,
                    medicine has not yet officially accepted adrenal
                    fatigue as a disease or syndrome.)&nbsp; The
                    paramount symptom is fatigue or a persistent
                    tiredness that does not seem to be relieved by
                    rest.&nbsp; Other symptoms may include aches, sleep
                    difficulties, digestive disorders, or a general
                    feeling of not being well.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>The common belief is that adrenal fatigue is the
                    result of the adrenal glands not being able to keep
                    up with the stress load of the individual.&nbsp;
                    This can be physical, emotional, or physiological
                    and can be accumulative if there are multiple and
                    prolonged conditions in one’s life.&nbsp; The
                    chronic stress may make it impossible for the
                    adrenal glands to maintain proper homeostasis.&nbsp;
                    Since the adrenal hormones control so many functions
                    of the body (energy levels, heart functions, immune
                    response, sex drive, etc.) a multiplicity of
                    symptoms can result as the body tries to balance
                    itself and restore homeostasis.</p>
