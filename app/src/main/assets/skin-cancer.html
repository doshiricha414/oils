Frankincense may be used concurrently.</p><p>Skin cancer most commonly comes from prolonged exposure to the UV rays in sunlight although cancerous spots can develop anywhere on the body.&nbsp; There are three types; the most common is basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and the most dangerous and least common is melanoma also spoken of as malignant melanoma.&nbsp; If detected early all are treatable with high success rates. Melanoma has the highest risk factors since it can metastasize early and spread to other areas of the body. UV rays from any source such as sunlight, medical radiation or tanning apparatus&nbsp; and it affects those with light colored skin more often than others.</p><p>Basal cell carcinoma forms at the base of the epidermis or outer layer of the skin. Most begin around hair follicles in sun-exposed areas. Visibly there are a variety of appearance. An open sore that does not heal, a red patch or yellow waxy area that may itch, a shiny bump or a pink craterlike structures.</p><p>Squamous cell carcinoma forms at the upper layer of the epidermis in the keratinocytes that are the most common cells of this protective layer of our body. The precursor is actinic keratosis wherein these cells form thick scaly or crusty patches. It may also develop as a blemish on the lip that looks like a cord sore but does not heal or a raised growth on the skin that looks like a wart but may often bleed. Again this happens most commonly in areas exposed to the sun and in those with light skin color. Often doctors will remove actinic keratosis areas since they have a high risk of developing into squamous cell carcinoma.</p><p>Malignant melanoma starts with the cells that produce melanin (the substance that gives the color to human skin, etc.) that are in the bottom layer of the epidermis. If this type of cancer develops it can metastasize quickly so it is important to recognize the signs and to seek proper medical attention if it is suspected.&nbsp; The common signs are a mole that changes in size, color, symmetry or border regularity. The ABCDEs of detection taken from the Melanoma Research Foundation website are:</p><p>A - Asymmetrical Shape</p><p>Melanoma lesions are typically irregular, or not symmetrical, in shape. Benign moles are usually symmetrical.</p><p>B - Border</p><p>Typically, non-cancerous moles have smooth, even borders. Melanoma lesions usually have iregular borders that are difficult to define.</p><p>C - Color</p><p>The presence of more than one color (blue, black, brown, tan, etc.) or the uneven distribution of color can sometimes be a warning sign of melanoma. Benign moles are usually a single shade of brown or tan.</p><p>D - Diameter</p><p>Melanoma lesions are often greater than 1/4 inch (6 millimeters) in diameter (approximately the size of a pencil eraser).</p><p>E - Evolution</p><p>The evolution of your moles(s) has become the most important factor to consider when it comes to melanoma. Knowing what is normal for YOU could save your life. If a mole has gone through recent changes in color and or size, get it checked out by a dermatologist immediately.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
