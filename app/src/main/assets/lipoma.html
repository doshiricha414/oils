Although they are usually painless there appearance may be annoying. There is no explanation of what causes them but they do seem to run in families. Even though they are fatty tissue the fact that someone might be overweight does not contribute to their occurence.</p><p>Some differences between lipomas and subcutaneous cysts are:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; A lipoma may be somewhat “lumpy”, a subcutaneous cyst will be a single smooth lump.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; A lipoma will have fairly well defined edges, a subcutaneous cyst will have softer edges.</p><p>Abscess, cancer, cyst, polyp or tumor?</p><p>Here are some differences between terms used to describe “masses” or “lumps” that may form in the body.&nbsp; Common terms are abscess, cancer, cyst, polyp and tumor.&nbsp;</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Tumor – a mass of tissue or abnormal cellular growth. They may be cancerous (malignant), or not (benign).</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Cancer – a rapid cellular growth that may spread from one part of the body to another.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Cyst – a closed sac filled with gas, liquid, or a semi solid. They are usually not cancerous.&nbsp;</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Lipoma – a benign growth filled with apidose (fat) cells usually just beneath the skin.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Abscess – similar to a cyst but is filled with pus.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Polyp – a tissue growth that protrudes from a mucous membrane (nasal passage, cervix, colon) usually benign.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
