Bladder control is not an uncommon problem especially with older adults.&nbsp;</p><p>Incontinence can be caused by some diseases and medicines and be a short-term problem or a long term or chronic conditions can be the result of medical procedures or bodily malfunctions.&nbsp;</p><p>Among women pregnancy or weight gain can stretch the muscles that support the bladder in the pelvic region.&nbsp; This lack of support puts pressure on the bladder and sphincter and does not allow them to function properly. Common among men are problems with the prostate gland that surrounds the urethra and is just under the bladder and before the sphincter.&nbsp; An enlarge prostate, common in aging men, or treatment for prostate cancer can disrupt the normal functioning of bladder and sphincter muscles.</p><p>There are some physical things that can be done to help, especially women with weakened muscles in the pelvic area.&nbsp; Bladder retraining where a definite schedule is set for urination and followed rigorously (whether you need to go or not) with a widening period of time till a comfortable 3 to 4 hour period is reached.&nbsp; Another is Kegel exercises that strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor.&nbsp; Suggestions and experiences with essential oils can be viewed by clicking on the tabs above.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
