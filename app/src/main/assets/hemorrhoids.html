They can be itchy, bleeding and/or painful protrusions just under the skin. There are two types internal and external. Internal are inside the anal canal in the lower rectum and external are at the anus. They result from increased pressure in the veins often due to straining during bowel movements and during pregnancy. Scratching in an attempt to relieve the itching symptoms further weakens the area and compounds the problem.</p><p>Hemorrhoids are common among adults starting in their late 40s as well as women during pregnancy. They do not pose a serious health concern but do cause considerable discomfort.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/cypress" class="button halfsize">Cypress</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/helichrysum" class="button halfsize">Helichrysum</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a></p><p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong> Life Long Vitality supplements</p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/geranium" class="button halfsize">Geranium</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/peppermint" class="button halfsize">Peppermint</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/sandalwood" class="button halfsize">Sandalwood</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p><strong>Mild with itching</strong> - Helichrysum and/or Lavender apply topically 1- 2 drops of each oil directly to area of discomfort.
