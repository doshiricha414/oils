                  <p>The most often referred oils for their properties
                    to help with hemorrhaging are listed above. For
                    minor hemorrhaging topical application is suggested.
                    For any type of major hemorrhaging immediate
                    professional medical help should be sought.</p>
                  <p>Hemorrhage is the medical term to describe any type
                    of bleeding. There are many types ranging from a
                    small superficial cut in the skin to a severe
                    traumatic injury involving a major artery.
                    Hemorrhage can also be via one of the orifices in
                    the body or can be in a variety of internal organs
                    where the bleeding is not easily detected. We have
                    listed below some of the more common types of
                    hemorrhage.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><strong>Minor traumatic bleeding.</strong> Small
                    cuts and wounds are typically not dangerous and in
                    most cases the bleeding will stop with a little
                    assistance or on its own.</p>
                  <p><strong>Severe traumatic bleeding.</strong>
                    Depending on the blood vessel involved and the
                    severity of the injury the dangers vary. Severe
                    bleeding to a minor vein may be stopped by
                    application of pressure where a major artery may
                    require a temporary tourniquet and always medical
                    attention.</p>
                  <p><strong>Postoperative hemorrhage.</strong> Bleeding
                    after surgery can occur anywhere such a procedure
                    has taken place.</p>
                  <p><strong>Externalized bleeding. </strong>This
                    describes the class of hemorrhage where blood flows
                    from one of the natural orifices in the body. Ears,
                    nose, mouth, urethra, vagina or anus. These are
                    usually caused by disease or trauma within the body
                    leading to the bleeding detected in one of these
                    locations. These would include occurrences such as:</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Hemorrhoids&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Hematuria or blood in the
                    urine from urinary bleeding</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Hemoptysis or coughing up
                    blood from the lungs</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Menorrhagia or heavy menstrual
                    bleeding</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Nosebleeds</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Postpartum hemorrhage from
                    childbirth</p>
                  <p><strong>Internal bleeding. </strong>This describes
                    hemorrhages that occur within the body and may not
                    be detected immediately. Again the bleeding may be
                    from small capillaries, veins or arteries with
                    varying degrees of concern. A few types include:</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Brain hemorrhages including
                    stroke, aneurysm, intracranial bleeding from a head
                    injury, etc.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Hematemesis or bleeding within
                    the stomach</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Carcinoma (cancer) may cause
                    bleeding in the gastro-intestinal tract or lungs and
                    in some cases the small organs such as the kidney,
                    pancreas or prostate.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; A tubal pregnancy (ectopic)
                    will result in internal bleeding</p>
