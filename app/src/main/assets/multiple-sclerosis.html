                  <p>The nervous system is composed of multiple nerve
                    cells connected with Axons that deliver the
                    electrical impulses to and from the brain.&nbsp; The
                    Axon is protected by a sheath of fatty acid
                    substance called the Myelin sheath.&nbsp; Multiple
                    sclerosis is a condition wherein the body mistakenly
                    attacks this Myelin sheath (hence an autoimmune
                    disease) which in turn disrupts the communication
                    between the brain and various parts of the body.</p>

                    swallowing, bad balance, dizziness, poor memory or
                    concentration, or trouble with hearing or with
                    vision may also occur.&nbsp; Since, as damage to the
                    nerves continue, further deterioration is
                    experienced later symptoms may include the inability
                    to walk or talk.</p>
