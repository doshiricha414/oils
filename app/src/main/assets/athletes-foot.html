Place a cotton ball with Melaleuca or Cleansing Blend in each shoe and close them inside a bag overnight.</p><p>If you are treating someone else it is a good idea to cleanse with Melaleuca or Protective Blend after treatment so the fungal infection is not spread.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Athlete’s foot.</strong>&nbsp; Athlete’s foot is caused by a type of fungi called dermatophytes.&nbsp; There are three types of athlete’s foot.&nbsp; In any of the three types of athlete’s foot, especially if the fungal infection causes open sores, an added complication of a simultaneous bacterial infection may occur.&nbsp; The three type are:&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The most common is the between the toes (most often the fourth and fifth toes) and is accompanied by peeling or cracked skin with burning and itching.&nbsp; Tight shoes and socks with a warm, damp environment enables the fungus.</p><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Trichophyton rubrum fungus causes moccasin type athlete’s foot.&nbsp; In this case it usually begins with soreness of the feet then the sole of the foot can become dry, thick, and scaly.&nbsp; In difficult cases the infection can move to the toenails.</p><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The least common, known as “jungle rot” is caused by the fungus Trichophyton mentagrophytes.&nbsp; Symptoms include a sudden development of liquid filled blisters commonly on the bottom of the foot but may also be on the top.&nbsp; Secondary reactions to the fungus can cause a wave of blisters elsewhere on the body, arm, chest, sides, or fingers.</p><p>Of importance to essential oils users is that in any athlete’s foot problem the primarily infection is a fungal infection but in difficult situations it can include a bacterial infection.&nbsp; Both need to be addressed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ringworm.</strong>&nbsp; Tinea capitis and tinea corporis are the medical terms for ringworm of the scalp and ringworm of the body.&nbsp; Both are fungal infections of the top layer of the skin and the only thing in common with a worm is the circular shape.&nbsp; They can begin in a localized area and spread in a circular fashion even with the center region healing as the infection spreads outward.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides the characteristic red circular rash there may also be blisters and it is usually accompanied by itching.&nbsp; Ringworm of the scalp, common among children, can also leave bald patches on the head.&nbsp; The infection can be spread from person to person if clothing is shared or contact is frequent.&nbsp; Dogs can be a carrier as well.</p><p><strong>Jock Itch.&nbsp; </strong>This is another type of fungal infection known as tinea cruris.&nbsp; Again a red, itchy rash forms, sometimes is a ring shape.&nbsp; This is usually in moist warm areas of the body, hence the name, as athletes or overweight people will have this rash in the genital, inner thigh, or buttocks area.</p><p> </p></div></div></div></div></div>
