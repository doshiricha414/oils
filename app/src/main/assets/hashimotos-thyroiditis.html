Causes of hypothyroidism are identified as:</p><p>•&nbsp; Hashimoto’s thyroiditis – This is an autoimmune disease wherein the body attacks the tissue of the thyroid.&nbsp; The resulting inflammation and damage to the tissue results in reduced amounts or cessation of the hormones normally generated by the thyroid.&nbsp; This is the most common of hypothyroid disorders and occurs primarily in middle aged females but is also seen in men and children.</p><p>•&nbsp; Thyroid removal – The thyroid may be surgically or chemically removed to correct hyperthyroidism and hormonal balance must be achieved by other means.</p><p>•&nbsp; Iodine exposure – Exposure to excessive amounts of iodine can damage thyroidal tissue and result in hypothyroidism.&nbsp; Iodine can come from many medications for heart, cold, and sinus conditions as well as those used for some X-ray procedures. (An interesting development since the largest contributor to goiters in less developed countries and in earlier times in the developed countries is/was the lack of iodine in the diet.)</p><p> </p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/balance" class="button halfsize">Grounding Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/geranium" class="button halfsize">Geranium</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemongrass" class="button halfsize">Lemongrass</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/myrrh" class="button halfsize">Myrrh</a></p><p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong> GX Assist, Life Long Vitality supplements, PB Assist</p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/clove" class="button halfsize">Clove</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/melissa" class="button halfsize">Melissa</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/peppermint" class="button halfsize">Peppermint</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Strengthening the body systems is a must with any thyroid issue :&nbsp;</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp;GX Assist / PB Assist <a href="#/tab/info/detoxification" class="button halfsize">detoxification</a> /p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp;Lifelong V<span>itality</span> supplements</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp;The <a href="#/tab/info/massage-blend-technique" class="button halfsize">Massage Blend Technique</a> is an additional way to strengthen and&nbsp; balance the body</p><p><strong>Hypothyroidism&nbsp;including&nbsp; Hashimoto's thyroiditis</strong></p><p>Protocol 1</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp;2-4 drops Grounding Blend and Geranium</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp;2-4 drops Lemongrass and Myrrh</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp;Alternate the above two combinations weekly.&nbsp; Apply them directly to the thyroid area, the <a href="#/tab/info/reflexology" class="button halfsize">reflexology</a> points on the feet (great toes), and on the wrists multiple times per day.
