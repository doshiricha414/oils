The infection originates when the fungus coccidioides immitis, found in the desert floor, has its spores spread into the air via dust particles and these are inhaled and settle in the human (or animal) lung. In most instances the body protects itself and no symptoms are noted or only slight cold like symptoms occur. In those cases the person may never no they have had the infection unless at a later date x-rays reveal it had previously occurred.</p><p>In instances where the exposed person might have a weakened immune system or a large number of spores are inhaled the infection can be more severe and result in serious symptoms and an extended recovery period. Symptoms typically begin to appear 1 to 3 weeks after exposure. Symptoms can include chest pain, general weakness and loss of energy, joint stiffness and muscle aches, fever, headaches, swelling in legs/ankles or lumps on the lower legs. The recovery period can extend to months for some and for a few can become a chronic condition that includes waxing and waning of the symptoms.</p><p>In rare instances valley fever can become what is known as disseminated coccidioidomycosis. This means that the infection has spread from the lungs through the blood stream and is infecting other parts of the body. This can include the skin, skeletal system, lymph system, nervous system or other organs. This becomes a very serious health concern with difficult symptoms. Skin lesions can be a key indication that&nbsp; disseminated coccidioidomycosis is present.</p><p>In any of these conditions it should be noted that valley fever is not contagious and cannot be transferred from the infected to another person. Once infected the person will not become infected a second time as the body appears to develop an immunity. Also some ethnic groups are more susceptible including Native Americans and people of African or Philippine descent.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/cinnamon" class="button halfsize">Cinnamon</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/clove" class="button halfsize">Clove</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/teaTree" class="button halfsize">Melaleuca</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/onGuard" class="button halfsize">Protective Blend</a>,&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/oregano" class="button halfsize">Oregano</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/rosemary" class="button halfsize">Rosemary</a>,&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/thyme" class="button halfsize">Thyme</a></p><p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong> <a href="#/tab/info/massage-blend-technique" class="button halfsize"><a href="#/tab/info/massage-blend-technique" class="button halfsize">Massage Blend Technique</a></a>, Life Long Vitality supplements, Mito2Max</p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Note, we have not found a particular essential oils protocol documented to help with valley fever. The suggestions below are based on helping manage symptoms and on folks' understanding of the root problem being a fungal infection in the lungs.</p><p>Strengthen the immune system and increase energy levels:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Life Long Vitality supplements coupled with <a href="#/tab/info/massage-blend-technique" class="button halfsize">Massage Blend Technique</a> massage at least weekly and better daily.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Consider the Mito2Max supplement.</p><p>Fungal infection in lungs:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Protective Blend and the oils mentioned above are potent antifungal agents. (At the present time we find no reported research or scientific studies of essential oils and coccidioides immitis.) If it were me I would use the Protective Blend blend supplemented with Cinnamon and Melaleuca.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; For application I would use diffusing as much as possible plus make an inhaler with these oils to carry and breathe deeply and often. It was suggested to inhale the blend Respiratory Blend first to open the airways then inhale the antifungal oils. Cup and Inhale (deeply) and capsules are also mentioned.</p><p>Symptoms:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; For headaches, muscle and joint pain etc the normal protocols for these discomforts can be followed.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
