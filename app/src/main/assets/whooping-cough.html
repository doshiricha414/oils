This is a highly contagious disease that is easily passed to others through coughing and tiny droplets containing the bacteria being transferred to others. It is limited in our day because of the prevalence of vaccination. The cases that do occur now are typically among infants where the vaccination has not been completed or adolescents and adults because the immunization tends to weaken over time.</p><p>After exposure it takes about a week for the first symptoms, similar to a common cold, to appear. Then in 1 to 2 weeks the characteristic dry cough begins and this lasts up to 6 weeks. The name whooping cough comes from this coughing period, which for many includes uncontrolled coughing with a lack of breath, and then a whooping sound as the person tries to catch their breath after the coughing episode. These coughing episodes may be more acute with younger children than with infants or adults. Coughing spells can include uncomfortable gasping for breath, vomiting and temporary unconsciousness.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/breathe" class="button halfsize">Respiratory Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/cypress" class="button halfsize">Cypress</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/grapefruit" class="button halfsize">Grapefruit</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/onGuard" class="button halfsize">Protective Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/oregano" class="button halfsize">Oregano</a></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/basil" class="button halfsize">Basil</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/clarySage" class="button halfsize">Clary Sage</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/eucalyptusRadiata" class="button halfsize">Eucalyptus</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemongrass" class="button halfsize">Lemongrass</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lime" class="button halfsize">Lime</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/teaTree" class="button halfsize">Melaleuca</a>, Rose, <a href="#/tab/oils/rosemary" class="button halfsize">Rosemary</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/thyme" class="button halfsize">Thyme</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>Adults: 5 drops Protective Blend, 2 drops each Frankincense and Oregano in a capsule, take 2 times per day.
