          you're hoping for.</span> The problem is, all too often, these
        supposedly therapeutic-grade essential oils don't quite live up
        to their billing.&nbsp; Sometimes their chemical profile just
        doesn't meet an acceptable standard; other times, the chemistry
        <em>looks</em> good — but only because it has been <em>spiked</em>
        with a <em>synthetic</em> chemical.&nbsp; Some oils, marketed
        as therapeutic-grade, are actually <em>totally synthetic</em>.&nbsp;

        <h2>The quality of essential oils </h2>
        <p>There is a small percent of oils on the market that are 100%
          pure and natural, free of synthetic compounds or contaminates
          (including pesticides), and <em>far</em> exceeding the AFNOR
          and ISO quality standards.&nbsp; Sadly, even at some "name"
          essential oil companies, ones that promote their oils as
          therapeutic-grade and that make statements about how each
          batch of oil is independently tested, the reality is often
          quite different.&nbsp; Too often, the oils are minimally
          tested at in-house labs.&nbsp; This is cost-effective, but
          doesn't give you any assurance of quality, beyond your trust
          for the company. <br>
        </p>
        <p>In order for an essential oil to be 100% pure and natural,
          should be carefully sourced from qualified and reliable
          producers.&nbsp; In addition, each batch is thoroughly cross
          tested at independent labs, using state-of-the art gas
          chromatography (GC) and mass spectromety (MS), as well as
          other sophisticated testing, to ensure extract purity,
          composition, potency and activity.&nbsp; This quality testing
          ensures that each batch of oil<sup></sup>:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>contains the correct profile of active chemical compounds
            suitable for use in aromatherapy, and </li>
          <li>doesn't contain any synthetic constituents or chemical
            adulterations. </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Purity is not the whole story</h2>
        <p>In producing an oil that is truly therapeutic-grade, it is
          not enough that the oil is 100% pure.&nbsp; Even though an
          essential oil is 100% pure, if the right species or part of a
          plant has not been used, or if the plant has not been grown in
          the right environment or harvested at the right time, or if it
          has not been distilled under the right conditions, the natural
          chemical make-up of the extracted oil will not provide
          predictable and powerful benefits. <br>
        </p>
        <p>The best oils come from producers who have extensive
          knowledge of how quality oils are produced.&nbsp; No
          short-cuts are tolerated, because it's all about the quality
          of the end product — and how it works for you.&nbsp; And,
          while these producers are trusted, each batch of oil is proven
          in the lab. </p>
