                  <p>Hot flashes are one of the common symptoms of the
                    menopausal change as the body naturally rebalances
                    the hormonal levels during that period in
                    life.&nbsp; This may be during menopause, premature
                    menopause, or induced menopause.&nbsp; They can also
                    occur at times other than menopause if there are
                    significant changes in hormonal levels.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Usually the face becomes flushed and red and there
                    is suddenly a feeling of being very warm or hot in
                    the face, neck, and/or chest.&nbsp; This may also be
                    accompanied by perspiration, chill, or an increased
                    heart rate.&nbsp; The intensity and frequency varies
                    widely with different individuals.&nbsp; Some
                    experience very uncomfortable hot flashes multiple
                    times a day where others may have mild annoying
                    experiences only multiple times a week.&nbsp; Hot
                    flashes with intense perspiration at night are
                    called night sweats.</p>
