    <p><span class="label1">Rosemary</span> is an aromatic, evergreen
      shrub whose leaves are frequently used to flavor foods, such as
      stuffings and roast lamb, pork, chicken and turkey.&nbsp; <span
        class="label1">Rosemary</span> oil can be used in much the same
      way; but, along with its culinary applications, <span
        class="label1">rosemary</span> has many health benefits.&nbsp;
      It supports healthy digestion, helps soothe sore muscles and
      joints, and helps to reduce nervous tension and fatigue. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Long revered by healers, for its digestive uses, and for
        soothing sore muscles and joints, <span class="label1">rosemary</span>
        was considered sacred by the ancient Greek, Roman, Egyptian and
        Hebrew cultures.&nbsp; Rosemary's herbaceous and energizing
        scent is frequently used in aromatherapy, to help reduce nervous
        tension and fatigue. </p>
      <p>Rosemary oil is steam distilled from the flowers and leaves of
        the <em class="noLink">Rosmarinus officinalis</em> plant,
        yielding an oil with a distinctive camphoraceous, herbaceous
        aroma.&nbsp; This <span class="noLink">cineol</span>&nbsp;chemo-type
        is high in the oxide <span class="noLink">1,8 cineol</span> (up
        to 55%), otherwise known as <span class="noLink">eucalyptol</span>.
