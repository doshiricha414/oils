The infection is commonly from parasites but can also be bacterial, viral or toxic. Symptoms typically include abdominal pain, tenesmus (straining during stools), diarrhea containing mucous and/or blood and fever.</p><p>Dysentery generally affects the colon area whereas most disorders giving cause to diarrhea are associated with the stomach and small intestines.&nbsp; Dysentery can have serious implications where most cases of typical diarrhea are uncomfortable but not serious unless the dehydration is not addressed.&nbsp; A major way to distinguish between the two is that diarrhea will have a more watery voluminous stool while with dysentery the stools will be smaller, not as watery with more mucous and/or blood and will be accompanied by tenesmus, fever and cramping.</p><p>Conditions that foster dysentery are typically found in less developed countries of the world or other localities where poor sanitation and poor hygiene fosters the growth and transmission of the infectious agents. Those visiting or temporarily residing in these areas become susceptible as well.&nbsp; Some of the more common infectious agents are described below:</p><p><strong>Amoebic dysentery</strong> is a protozoan (entamoeba histolytica), a one cell parasite, that enters the digestive tract in a basic form known as cyst. They then develop into the trophozoite form, multiply, attach to the lining of the intestines and begin their damage. Some then can be excreted from the body and return to the cyst form, which allows them to survive and potentially infect again. Some that attach to the intestine lining can penetrate the lining and can be carried to other organs of the body.</p><p>Amoebic dysentery develops slowly with the diarrhea like mucous/blood stools and usually no fever. A risk is dehydration and serious inflammation of the colon leading to severe abdominal pain and possible rupture of the colon.</p><p><strong>Balantidiasis, giardiasis, and cryptosporidiosis</strong> (Balantidium coli, Giardia lamblia, and Cryptosporidium parvum) are each protozoa that infect the digestive tract and develop a mild form of dysentery commonly referred to as traveler’s diarrhea (Montezuma’s revenge).</p><p>Symptoms of giardiasis infection are delayed about 1 to 3 weeks after exposure.&nbsp; When symptoms appear they include bloating with foul smelling gas, headaches, low-grade fever, nausea and vomiting.&nbsp; Cryptosporidiosis infection is typically milder but may include heavy diarrhea starting 7 to 10 days after exposure, nausea and vomiting.&nbsp; Usually no fever.</p><p><strong>Bacillary dysentery (shigellosis)</strong>, is caused by various forms of Shigella. This is a group of bacteria that can cause an acute bacterial infection of the lining of the intestines.&nbsp; These bacteria can be released in the stools of an infected person and passed to others. Areas at risk are areas of poor sanitation or those that may travel to such areas and be exposed to poor sanitation practices.</p><p>Symptoms develop in 1 to 7 days after being in contact with the bacterium. Symptoms include acute and sudden abdominal pain and fever plus stools that may range from those with blood, mucus or pus to watery diarrhea.&nbsp; Additionally nausea, rectal pain (tenesmus) and vomiting may occur.</p><p><strong>Viral dysentery</strong> or also referred to as viral gastroenteritis or stomach flu is a viral infection and can come from a variety of viruses including adenovirus, astrovirus, caliciviruses, norovirus and rotavirus. The latter two being common among children while caliciviruses is a more common infectious agent among adults. None of these virus strains are related to those responsible for the common cold or flu (influenza) that affect the respiratory system.</p><p>Symptoms appear rapidly after contacting the infection, usually with 4 to 48 hours.&nbsp; Symptoms usually will include some abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting then followed with diarrhea. A low-grade fever and headache may also occur but symptoms will usually differ from respiratory influenza (the flu) which typically will include high fever, muscle aches, fatigue and respiratory congestion.</p><p><strong>Parasitic worms</strong> also result in dysentery. Both whipworm (trichuriasis) and flatworm or fluke (schistosomiasis) infestations may produce the violent diarrhea and abdominal cramps associated with dysentery.&nbsp; see also Parasite Infections for more varieties.</p><p>Symptoms typically develop gradually and will include fatigue, bloody diarrhea, and abdominal pain.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
