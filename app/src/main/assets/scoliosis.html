A normal spine has a slight S curvature when viewed from the side and is straight when viewed from the back or front. With scoliosis a curvature will be apparent when a person is viewed from the back or front. This can also be exhibited with one shoulder drooping or an uneven shoulder level when the person is stooped over. Scoliosis is often noticed in children as they grow rapidly just before puberty. Some forms can be the result of other diseases and there seems to be a genetic factor but most commonly the cause is not known. The common ages are from 10 to 16 and is more common in females.</p><p>Different types of scoliosis include:</p><p><strong>Idiopathic scoliosis</strong> is the most common type and as the name suggests there is no identifiable cause. Common subcatagories are:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Congenital scoliosis – Present at birth</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Infantile scoliosis – In children 3 and younger</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Juvenile scoliosis – In children 4 – 10</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Adolescent scoliosis – Pre and teenage children 11 –18 &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Neuromuscular scoliosis</strong> – A condition caused by nervous system problems that affects the muscles. This can accompany spina bifida, cerebral palsy or forms of paralysis.</p><p><strong>Degenerative scoliosis –</strong> This can develop because of injury, surgery or bone degeneration from osteoporosis.</p><p><strong>Kyphoscoliosis </strong>is another type of abnormal curving of the spine.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
