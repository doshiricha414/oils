There seems to be some connection between having this disorder and a history of it in one’s family. Although this condition is thought to be a long-term illness many report that with proper help they are living comfortable and productive lives.</p><p>Types of bipolar disorder:</p><p>Since symptoms can vary greatly from person to person professionals use four terms to describe various types of bipolar disorder. Bipolar type I, have manic episodes and periods of mayor depression; bipolar type II, have lower episodes of mania (hypomania) that alternate with episodes of depression; cyclothymia, a milder form; and BP-NOS (bipolar not otherwise specified) for those with the symptoms but do not fit the criteria for the previous types.</p><p> </p><p><strong>PubMed</strong> give the following helpful information about the symptoms of bipolar disorder:</p><p>In most people with bipolar disorder, there is no clear cause for the manic or depressive episodes. The following may trigger a manic episode in people with bipolar disorder:</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Life changes such as childbirth</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Medications such as antidepressants or steroids</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Periods of sleeplessness</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Recreational drug use</p><p>Symptoms</p><p>The manic phase may last from days to months. It can include the following symptoms:</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Easily distracted</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Little need for sleep</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor judgment</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor temper control</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Reckless behavior and lack of self control</p><p>•&nbsp; Binge eating, drinking, and/or drug use</p><p>•&nbsp; Poor judgment</p><p>•&nbsp; Sex with many partners (promiscuity)</p><p>•&nbsp; Spending sprees</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Very elevated mood</p><p>•&nbsp; Excess activity (hyperactivity)</p><p>•&nbsp; Increased energy</p><p>•&nbsp; Racing thoughts</p><p>•&nbsp; Talking a lot</p><p>•&nbsp; Very high self-esteem (false beliefs about self or abilities)</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Very involved in activities</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Very upset (agitated or irritated)</p><p>These symptoms of mania occur with bipolar disorder I. In people with bipolar disorder II, the symptoms of mania are similar but less intense.</p><p>The depressed phase of both types of bipolar disorder includes the following symptoms:</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Daily low mood or sadness</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Eating problems</p><p>•&nbsp; Loss of appetite and weight loss</p><p>•&nbsp; Overeating and weight gain</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Fatigue or lack of energy</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Feeling worthless, hopeless, or guilty</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Loss of pleasure in activities once enjoyed</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Loss of self-esteem</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Thoughts of death and suicide</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Trouble getting to sleep or sleeping too much</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Pulling away from friends or activities that were once enjoyed</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/balance" class="button halfsize">Grounding Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/elevation" class="button halfsize">Joyful Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/melissa" class="button halfsize">Melissa</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/serenity" class="button halfsize">Calming Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/vetiver" class="button halfsize">Vetiver</a></p><p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong> Lifelong Vitality supplements</p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/clarySage" class="button halfsize">Clary Sage</a></p><p>Suggested protocols:</p><p><strong>Proper nutritional balance </strong>- Along with healthy eating habits use the Lifelong Vitality supplements.</p><p><strong>Clarify and focus -</strong> Use inhalation of Grounding Blend, Frankincense, or Vetiver.

Also consider inhalation of Lavender. Use these same oils with a foot massage.

It emphasizes the point that oils and nutritional help needs to be coupled with many other conditions to provide lasting help.&nbsp; Read her full story under the Experiences &amp; Testimonials tab above.</em></p><p>Explanation - Lifestyle Prevents Disease.</p><p>If you hit a breaking point in your life chances are that you have to assess your lifestyle. Assess all the different forms of health as they affect each other... Physical, Emotional, Mental, Spiritual, Financial, and Social.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Your physical health - Sleep, Diet, Exercise, Stress management &lt;-- All effect each other and all effect the body and other forms of health.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Your emotional health - Find what true love is whether it is agape, phileo, eros, or storge. Also know the five languages of love (there is a great book by Dr. Gary Chapman) This ties in with Social health</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Your Social Health - How are your relationships?</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Your Financial Health - An important aspect. Do you have a peace of mind? Do you have related stress that has to do with perceived view of income or security?</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Your Spiritual Health - Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs shows that people are looking for purpose. This may lead to a search for God. I encourage everyone to go on the search; I have friends with different faiths. My journey lead me to strengthen my relationship with Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior in Christianity.</p><p>All of those were in place. I went to school. I slept well and ate well and also worked out at times. I had made friends and spent a lot of quality. I had no worry of finances or the roof over my head. I prayed and I fellowshipped with people who shared the same faith and exchanged ideas with people of different faiths.</p><p>Being off medications for six years and counting can be attributed to all these things but if there is any one aspect I would have focused on as a priority for the rest would be prayer and spiritual health because sometimes in that situation you need a miracle, you need hope, that seemingly can’t be found, and you need love. &lt;-- That's my personal view I hope you don't mind.</p><p>Tips on treating people that are struggling with emotional health.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Be there - sometimes being there is more than enough. It can be frustrating to figure out what a person wants. Being there is better than not, even though they try to push you away, because when we come to our sense we will remember that kind of love.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Don't push (or offer at the right time) If you offer a solution when a person is defensive, you might experience some crazy rage. If you offer it while they are euphoric, you may not get a serious understanding of the solution. If they are depressed, they might try anything to take away the torment. Either way, always share with love.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Inspire people to take action.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Treat people with dignity. I've always disliked my diagnosis because I felt as if I was looked down upon. Labeled as mentally unfit, unsound.</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Know that it's not them, it's their body and condition. This may be the hardest because you know your friend wouldn't do such a thing, how can they? And you may not want to forgive them and let them go on the excuse that it's their condition. But please a person who is in the better situation in control of emotions and let it go and forgive.</p><p>"<em>Forgiveness is the final form of love.</em> -Reinhold Niebuhr" I agree with you, what they did isn't right, I acknowledge that now let go. I've pushed away and destroyed many relationships that took me a few years to recover, some never fully recovered. It's quite painful. All the above will help prevent or understand that.</p><p>One obstacle is letting go and willing to combat against bipolar disorder. As ridiculous as it sounds there were times I was okay with it and considered it a blessing. I thought I could figure out to ride the waves of emotion. Instead my emotions rode me and I was frustrated and on the verge of not being all together there. I do remember this quote by John Wooden, which reminded me as a leader to never think of using emotions as a strength. "<em>Emotionalism can be a fatal flaw. I place the greatest VALUE on intensity. It's the difference between a welder's arc and a forest Fire. Both have plenty of heat, but the welder's torch cuts through the steel with precision, while the forest Fire rages out of control and destroys the forest</em>." - John Wooden.</p><p>SO WHICH Oil?</p><p>I do believe oils work. I use them. I have firsthand experience especially with bursts of anger, stress, depression, restlessness. Why did I tell the whole story first?</p><p>1. Oils are like a crutch, they will help alleviate some of the emotions, but you must change your lifestyle to prevent emotional instability. Just as people who have physical issues such as diabetes, cardiovascular issues, etc... Oils work wonders but you have to do your part.</p><p>2. To build trust and rapport. I have seen this question pop on and on again. I've told people the oil I use and is sometimes disregarded leaving a person with mediocre results without even attempting to use the oil I suggested.</p><p>3. As by the story I shared about myself, it is not a one-dimensional issue. There are so many aspects. I believe that it will spark a journey. For me, it was resolving many personal issues from the past.</p><p>4. If you simply rely on the oil for it, you are treating your body how your doctor treats your body. You have “such and such”, take this. As a practitioner of natural medicine, you must take a different approach than western medicine, which is very specialized.</p><p>AND THE OILS ARE....</p><p>1. <strong>Melissa</strong>. I've shared this with people and perhaps people disregard it in the past because it was not readily available. I guess people are hesitant when you offer a solution that so happens to be one of the most expensive oils. I own every oil. Invigorating Blend is great diffused but for me Melissa is most effective. I place it on my upper lip and the back of my neck . I used this for stress. Sometimes I'm a bit tense. It's good to have a loved one who recognized this to apply it when you may not choose to.</p><p>2. <strong>Frankincense.</strong> Frankincense is known for everything. I am starting to use it more and more but it seems to work with my body beyond my understanding. Frankincense has inadvertently helped aid me with my sleep. I apply it topically. Though Calming Blend helps calm me down and has helped with the peacefulness of sleep. Frankincense has really helped with the quality or depth of sleep. I notice that I recall my dreams, which is commonly theorized to occur during REM Sleep.</p><p>3. <strong>Calming Blend.</strong> I diffuse this and put it on the bottom of my feet. Sleep is important for all aspects of health including mental. first thing to get some sense of mind back is to get good sleep. Oils help but make sure your biological rhythms are in tune. What you eat, when you eat, how much exercise, when you exercise, these are all factors for sleep in addition to using your oils.</p><p>4. <strong>Joyful Blend.</strong> Though I don't personally diffuse this. There were times my family members would diffuse this perhaps because of the Melissa inside and they have observed differences.</p><p>5. <strong>Lifelong Vitality Pack</strong> - Though not an oil but an excellent doTERRA product (which contains EOs such as Frankincense) The Omega Fatty Acids which are emulsified with its advanced delivery system is great for your brain health. The Alpha CRS+ has great ingredients such as oppa Monierri which helps with cognitve function. The Microplex VMz is a highest nutrient/vitamin supplement which is in the form of a whole food complex which is combined with an enzyme delivery system. Your body and brain needs nutrients.</p><p>Don't forget to drink lots of water! I hope all this information helps. Thank you and God bless.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
