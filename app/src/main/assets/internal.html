                <div class="sqs-block-content">Of those that write on
                  oils use there is a wide variety of opinions about
                  internal consumption.&nbsp; Some recommend it often,
                  others distance themselves from it.&nbsp; Internal
                  consumption of essential oils is best done with
                  professional advice.&nbsp; Listed here are some common
                  techniques to consider:<br>
                  <br>
                  <ul>
                    <li><span><span></span></span><strong>Tea - </strong>A
                      common methods for ingesting essential oils are to
                      add 1 or 2 drops to a half cup of warm water and
                      drink or sip as needed.&nbsp; (This is often used
                      for an upset stomach with an oil like Peppermint
                      or a blend such as DigestZen).&nbsp; Use care not
                      to have the water too warm as the oils will
                      dissipate rapidly and you will lose the potency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Capsules -</strong> Many add the oils in
                      a capsule and taking orally as you would
                      traditional medications.&nbsp; Depending on the
                      strength needed a carrier oil may be added to the
                      capsule to "buffer" the essential oil.&nbsp; Also
                      many protocols have multiple oils added to the
                      same capsule for a desired blend.</li>
                    <li><strong>Swishing- </strong>or allergies a
                      method is suggested of adding 2 to 6 drops of oils
                      (Peppermint, Lemon and/or Lavender) to a teaspoon
                      of water and swishing in the mouth for a minute
                      and swallowing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pulling Oils - </strong>Not quite
                      considered ingestion, but does involve oils in the
                      mouth, is the method of â€˜pulling oil.â€™&nbsp;
                      This is a therapy that is proven to improve the
                      health of gums and teeth.&nbsp; Others feel it has
                      further detoxifying qualities.&nbsp; Choose an
                      appropriate carrier such as grapeseed, coconut, or
                      olive oil.&nbsp; Combine 2 drops of an essential
                      oil such as <strong><em>Clove, Myrrh,</em></strong>
                      or <strong><em>Peppermint</em></strong>.&nbsp;
                      Then without swallowing, swish and pull the oil
                      mixture through the teeth and around the mouth for
                      5-10 minutes, then spit out the mixture without
                      swallowing.&nbsp; Then brush the teeth.</li>
                    <li><span><span></span></span> <strong>Enema</strong>
                      - Affectionately called the Butt Bomb.&nbsp; Add
                      the desired oils to a 00 capsule and fill the
                      remainder with coconut oil and insert
                      appropriately or add the oils and approximately 25
                      drops of carrier oil to the enema syringe and
                      apply. (the reason for this uncomfortable protocol
                      is that this is one of the more effective ways to
                      get oils deep into the lungs)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><br>
                    Before taking an oil internally, check its
                    references and determine that it is certified as
                    GRAS (generally regarded as safe) by the FDA.&nbsp;
                    <br>
                  </p>
                  There are oils, however, that you would want to be
                  careful to use internally such as Wintergreen. In very
                  high amounts, Wintergreen essential oil can make you
                  sick and even severely ill if you are a child.
