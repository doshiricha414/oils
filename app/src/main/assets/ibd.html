                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) is not a single
                    condition but rather includes a number of conditions
                    that all result in the inflammation of various parts
                    of the digestive system.&nbsp; The two most common
                    types are ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s
                    disease.&nbsp; Others will be listed below.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ulcerative colitis.</strong>&nbsp;
                    This is restricted to the colon and the rectum and
                    affects the innermost lining of the organ. It is
                    uncertain if it is an autoimmune disease.</p>
                  <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crohn's disease. </strong>&nbsp;
                    This can affect any part of the gastrointestinal
                    tract from the oral cavity to the anus and often is
                    in multiple locations or patches (skip
                    lesions).&nbsp; It not only affects the lining but
                    may go deep into the wall of the organ.&nbsp; It is
                    considered by most to be an&nbsp; auto-immune
                    disease.</p>
                  <p>Symptoms vary greatly from person to person but may
                    include chronic constipation, diarrhea, abdominal
                    discomfort or pain.&nbsp; Discomfort often comes in
                    episodes and may be triggered by stress,
                    insufficient fluids, inadequate nutrition, allergic
                    reaction to certain foods, or just not eating
                    properly (gulping a meal down, eating on the run,
                    etc.).</p>
                  <p>Other forms of IBD are:</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Infectious Colitis.</strong>
                    Viruses and bacteria can cause colon infections.
                    Most are food-borne illnesses or "food
                    poisoning."&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong> Pseudomembranous
                      colitis.</strong> This is often seen in patients
                    who have recently been taking antibiotics for an
                    infection. The antibiotic alters the normal bacteria
                    present in the colon and allows an overgrowth of the
                    Clostridium bacteria which produces a toxin that
                    causes diarrhea. This is an infection, and often
                    there is a fever present. The diarrhea is usually
                    not bloody.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Ischemic Colitis.</strong>&nbsp;
                    The arteries that supply blood to colon the have the
                    potential to narrow due to atherosclerosis (just
                    like blood vessels in the heart) and other
                    conditions. When these arteries narrow, the colon
                    loses it's blood supply and becomes inflamed.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Microscopic Colitis.</strong>
                    Two diseases make up this group of colon
                    inflammation, collagenous colitis and lymphocytic
                    colitis. In these diseases, the inflammation is
                    caused by some layers of the colon wall becoming
                    engorged with either collagen or lymphocytes.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Chemical Colitis.</strong>&nbsp;
                    If chemicals are instilled into the colon,
                    inflammation and damage can occur. One of the
                    complications of an enema is the inflammation of the
                    mucosal lining of the colon caused by harsh
                    chemicals.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>3 Problems with similar symptoms</p>
                  <p>IBS (irritated bowel syndrome), IBD (inflammatory
                    bowel disease), and celiac disease.&nbsp; What is
                    the difference?</p>
                  <p>All three conditions can have similar symptoms
                    hence sometimes leading to confusion.&nbsp; Further
                    complicating this is the fact that IBS is very
                    common, occurring in as many as twenty percent of
                    Americans while IBD and Celiac are less
                    frequent.&nbsp; Therefore, since the symptoms may be
                    similar, there is often a quick diagnostic
                    conclusion of the more common IBS.&nbsp; Here is a
                    summary of differences:</p>
                  <p><strong>IBS – Irritable bowel syndrome</strong></p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technically this is a disorder
                    rather than a disease because the bowels are not
                    damaged.&nbsp; Some believe that nerves that control
                    the contractions of the bowels that move food
                    through the intestinal tract send incorrect signals
                    to the colon or rectum.&nbsp; These contractions,
                    that are normally regular, may then increase in
                    frequency or become spasmodic leading to the
                    symptoms often experienced.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Symptoms may include
                    chronic constipation, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort
                    or pain.&nbsp; It can be triggered by stress,
                    insufficient fluids, inadequate nutrition, allergic
                    reaction to certain foods, or just not eating
                    properly (gulping a meal down, eating on the run,
                    etc.).</p>
                  <p><span>IBD – Inflammatory bowel disease</span></p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This term refers to a number of
                    different diseases of the bowels.&nbsp; They are
                    typically chronic conditions with inflammation of
                    different areas of the intestine and may cause
                    eventual damage.&nbsp; Often they are associated
                    with or are themselves autoimmune in nature.&nbsp;
                    The two most common forms are ulcerative colitis and
                    Crohn’s disease.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Symptoms may include diarrhea,
                    abdominal pain, weight loss, bloody stools, and/or a
                    fullness and pain in the lower right abdomen.&nbsp;
                    Blood tests will show unique markers that are not
                    present in IBD.</p>
                  <p><strong>Celiac disease</strong></p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Celiac disease is genetic and an
                    autoimmune disease wherein the body mistakenly
                    attacks gluten and other proteins found in grains
                    that are in the digestive tract.&nbsp; As with IBD
                    and unlike IBS, this is a disease causes damage to
                    the intestinal system.&nbsp; With celiac the damage
                    is done to the lining of the small intestines but
                    IBD can be anywhere in the intestinal tract.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the symptoms include
                    diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence with
                    a bad odor, fatty stools (pale, large, bad odor,
                    floating), weight loss and others.&nbsp; Celiac has
                    been reported to be triggered by trauma after
                    surgery, childbirth, stress, and even viral
                    infection.</p>
