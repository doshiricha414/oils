      essential oil, with a rich, warm and spicy aroma, that promotes

        <blockquote>
          <p><span class="label1">Frankincense</span> is from the <span
              class="noLink">Burseraceae</span> family (resinous trees
            and shrubs), and is found in three primary species: <span
              class="noLink"><em>Boswellia frereana</em></span><em>, <span
                class="noLink">B. carterii</span> and <span
                class="noLink">B. sacra</span></em>.&nbsp; The oil is
            steam distilled from the gum or resin, yielding an oil with
            a warm, spicy, clean aroma, and has high levels of <span
              class="noLink">α-pinene</span>. </p>
          <p>As the king of oils, <span class="label1">frankincense</span>

            Renowned as one of the most-prized and precious of the
            essential oils, its notoriety extends back to the ancient
            Egyptians, who used its resin for everything from perfume to
            salves for soothing skin.&nbsp; The Babylonians and
            Assyrians would burn <span class="label1">frankincense</span>
            in religious ceremonies. </p>
          <p>Mentioned frequently in Old Testament, <span
              class="label1">frankincense</span> was part of the holy
            anointing oil.&nbsp; And, of course, frankincense was one of
            the gifts given to the Christ child, and it is mentioned in
            the book of Revelation as a traded commodity, even into the
            last days. </p>
          <p><span class="label1">Frankincense</span> is highly sought
            after by <em>modern</em> consumers, as well, with a body of

            and beautifying properties can be used to rejuvenate skin
            and reduce the appearance of blemishes.&nbsp; It is known to
            promote cellular health and help to build and maintain a
            healthy immune system, supporting healthy immune system
            function.&nbsp; And, when inhaled or diffused, <span
              class="label1">frankincense</span> induces feelings of
            peace, relaxation, satisfaction and overall wellness. </p>
          <p>Whether used aromatically, topically or internally, <span
              class="label1">frankincense</span> can be consumed daily
            for its many internal benefits. </p>
