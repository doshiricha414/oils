    <p>Used widely for its therapeutic, calming effect on the skin, mind

      especially soothing to the systems of the body, and helps to

    <blockquote>
      <p>The <em class="noLink">Anthemis nobilis</em> plant grows close
        to the ground, reaching only up to a foot in height.&nbsp; It
        has gray-green leaves, flowers that resemble a daisy and smells
        like apple.&nbsp; The plant has been nicknamed the "plant's
        physician", because it has positive effects on plants growing
        nearby.&nbsp; Ancient Romans used the <span class="label1">chamomile</span>
        for mental clarity and courage during war. </p>
      <p>The oil is steam distilled from the flowers of the small,
        white, daisy-like flower of the <em class="noLink">Anthemis
          nobilis</em> plant, yielding an oil with a floral, sweet,
        herbaceous aroma, high in the chemical compounds of <span
          class="noLink">isobutyl angelate</span> and <span
          class="noLink">isoamyl angelate</span>. </p>
      <p>The most versatile of the chamomiles, <span class="label1">Roman
          chamomile</span> oil is most commonly used in teas; but it can
        also be found in face creams, drinks, hair dyes, shampoos and
        perfumes. </p>
      <p>With a therapeutic, calming effect on all types of skin, <span
          class="label1">Roman chamomile</span> oil is used extensively
        in Europe, in skin preparations for young and old alike.&nbsp;
        Its calming effect on both the mind and body makes it <em>especially</em>
        valuable for restless children. </p>
