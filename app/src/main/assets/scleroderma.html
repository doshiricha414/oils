There is mentioned in the literature localized scleroderma and systemic scleroderma or progressive systemic scleroderma. The first usually involves the skin on the hands and the face and does not usually progress beyond that. The latter may affect large areas of skin as well as connective tissue in major organs of the body. What causes scleroderma is not known, it usually begins in mid-life and affects females more than males.</p><p>The symptoms of localized scleroderma are hardening or thickening of the skin that results in a tightness of the skin. This tightness, if in the hands, can lead to stiffness of the fingers and hands. If in the face the tightness may give a mask-like appearance. The color of the skin may change as well to either abnormally light or dark. The symptoms of systemic scleroderma may include skin symptoms but also joint pain, breathing problems, digestive problems, esophagus problems (reflux, swallowing difficulty) or fecal incontinence.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/deepBlue" class="button halfsize">Soothing Blend</a>, DDR prime, <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemongrass" class="button halfsize">Lemongrass</a></p><p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong> Life Long Vitality supplements</p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/basil" class="button halfsize">Basil</a>, Birch, <a href="#/tab/oils/geranium" class="button halfsize">Geranium</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemon" class="button halfsize">Lemon</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/myrrh" class="button halfsize">Myrrh</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/sandalwood" class="button halfsize">Sandalwood</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/wildOrange" class="button halfsize">Wild Orange</a></p><p> </p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>see also general suggestions for <a class="button halfsize" href="#/tab/conditions/auto-immune">Auto-Immune Disorder.</a></p><p>Consistent use of the Life Long Vitality supplements and 8 drops or 1 capsule of DDR Prime 2 times per day. 2 -3 drops of Frankincense 2 - 4 times daily under the tongue or internally with a spoonful of honey or in a capsule.</p><p>Apply Soothing Blend and Lemongrass topically to the areas affected.</p><p>Also the following blends have been suggested:</p><p>3 drops each Birch, Soothing Blend and Lavender</p><p>4 drops each Myrrh and Sandalwood</p><p>Apply topically to the bottoms of the feet, along the spine and the outside of the ears alternating daily between the blends.</p><p>Some suggest a candida cleanse for autoimmune diseases.

If used consider that some with autoimmune disorders are particularly sensitive and should start this cleanse with 1 GX capsule daily for 2 days, if no skin or digestive reactions increase to 2 capsules for 2 days and then if no reactions to the prescribed 3 per day.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
