                    such as Crohn’s, diabetes, and ulcerative colitis.</p>
                  <p><strong>Traveler’s diarrhea</strong> (Montezuma’s
                    revenge) is a common difficulty of those that
                    travel. This is usually a bacterial infection but
                    can be from a variety of viruses and
                    parasites.&nbsp; Diarrhea is the most common symptom
                    and may be accompanied by abdominal pain, fever,
                    gas, loss of appetite and vomiting depending on the
                    infectious agent. The most common bacterial
                    infection for travelers is E. coli, viral is viral
                    gastroenteritis and parasitical are giardiasis and
                    cryptosporidiosis. For other gastric infections also

                  <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E. coli enteritis</strong>
                    is the common food poisoning to those that
                    travel.&nbsp; Meats that have not been handled
                    properly, unsanitary food preparation areas, dairy
                    or foods with mayonnaise not properly refrigerated
                    or undercooked eggs or meat are all possible
                    sources.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Symptoms usually occur
                    with in 24 to 72 hours of infection.&nbsp; Sudden
                    severe diarrhea that may be bloody is the most
                    common symptoms.&nbsp; Others symptoms may include
                    abdominal pain, fever, gas and/or loss of
                    appetite.&nbsp; Vomiting is rare.</p>
                  <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viral dysentery</strong>
                    or also referred to as viral gastroenteritis or
                    stomach flu is a viral infection and can come from a
                    variety of viruses including adenovirus, astrovirus,
                    caliciviruses, norovirus and rotavirus. The latter
                    two being common among children while caliciviruses
                    is a more common infectious agent among adults. None
                    of these virus strains are related to those
                    responsible for the common cold or flu (influenza)
                    that affect the respiratory system.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Symptoms appear rapidly
                    after contacting the infection, usually with 4 to 48
                    hours.&nbsp; Symptoms usually will include some
                    abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting then followed
                    with diarrhea. A low-grade fever and headache may
                    also occur but symptoms will usually differ from
                    respiratory influenza (the flu) which typically will
                    include high fever, muscle aches, fatigue and
                    respiratory congestion.</p>
                  <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Giardiasis, and
                      cryptosporidiosis </strong>(Giardia lamblia, and
                    Cryptosporidium parvum) are each protozoa that
                    infect the digestive tract and develop a mild form
                    of dysentery commonly referred to as traveler’s
                    diarrhea (Montezuma’s revenge).</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Symptoms of giardiasis
                    infection are delayed about 1 to 3 weeks after
                    exposure.&nbsp; When symptoms appear the include
                    bloating with foul smelling gas, headaches,
                    low-grade fever, nausea and vomiting.&nbsp;
                    Cryptosporidiosis infection is typically milder but
                    may include heavy diarrhea starting 7 to 10 days
                    after exposure, nausea and vomiting.&nbsp; Usually
                    no fever.</p>
