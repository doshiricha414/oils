                  <p>The most common gum and mouth problems are
                    periodontal diseases that are bacterial infections
                    that lead to inflammation and eventually destroy the
                    gums and other supporting tissues surrounding the
                    teeth. The bacteria is in a sticky, colorless film
                    called plaque that forms in the mouth and if not
                    removed it hardens on the teeth and is known as
                    tartar.&nbsp; Both plaque and tartar and the
                    bacteria involved irritate and inflame the
                    gums.&nbsp; The progression of periodontal disease
                    is:</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Gingivitis – gums are red,
                    swollen, and bleed easily.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Periodontal pockets – plaque
                    begins to form below the gum line and pockets form.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Periodontitis – The chronic
                    presence of plaque, tartar, and attending bacterial
                    infection destroys the gum and bone structure that
                    supports the teeth and may result in them becoming
                    loose and needing removal.</p>
                  <p>Beyond this clinical testing suggests that
                    periodontal diseases (gum disease) may be associated
                    with strokes, diabetes, heart, and other
                    cardiovascular problems. The prevailing opinion is
                    that a healthy mouth can enhance overall health, as
                    well as prolong the effective health of teeth. Other
                    mouth sores can range from cold sores that are a
                    viral infection in the mouth (see “Herpes Simplex”)
                    to simple abrasions. Cold sores are quite contagious
                    but their cousin, the canker sore, is not. Braces
                    rubbing the cheek, biting lips, biting inside the
                    cheek, or a very hot drink can cause abrasions.</p>

                  <p>For pain and discomfort</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clove (1-2 drops) applied
                    topically to the painful area of the gum, tooth, or
                    cheek will provide a numbing effect (for children
                    dilute with a pleasant tasting <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil).</p>
                  <p>To reduce inflammation, heal, and promote ongoing
                    gum health</p>
                  <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mild : </strong>Mix 1 or 4
                    drops of Myrrh in 1 tablespoon of water or a carrier
                    oil. Swish and pull the mixture through the teeth
                    for approximately 5-10 minutes 2-3 times daily Then
                    follow-up by brushing the teeth using Protective
                    Blend. Do not swallow. Lemon or Peppermint added to
                    the mixture may make the taste more acceptable.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other oils for mouth and gum
                    problems include: Eucalyptus, Frankincense,
                    Melaleuca, Rosemary, or Protective Blend blend.
                    These oils can be used in the same manner as Myrrh
                    above.</p>
                  <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; More aggressive: </strong></p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 tbsp
                    fractionated coconut oil</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 drops of Clove</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 drops of Oregano</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put the above
                    blend into your mouth, gently pull the oils around
                    and through your teeth for 10 minutes and then spit
                    it out up to three times a day.</p>
                  <p>For abrasions</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use one of the mouth washes
                    above using Lavender or Melaleuca instead of the
                    oils mentioned.</p>
                  <p>For simple sores</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Topically apply a drop of
                    Lavender or Melaleuca directly on the sore.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>For halitosis (bad breath)</p>
                  <p>( see also Peppermint based beadlet excellent for
                    halitosis.)</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peppermint or Lemongrass are
                    oils that will help with halitosis (bad breath) and
                    also are very antibacterial.</p>
