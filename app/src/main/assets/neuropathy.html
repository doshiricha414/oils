                  <p>Neuropathy, or peripheral neuropathy is damage to
                    the peripheral nervous system.&nbsp; This system of
                    nerves in the skin, muscles, and internal organs of
                    the body transmit information to the central nervous
                    system that includes the spinal cord and
                    brain.&nbsp; Damage to the peripheral nerves can
                    come from trauma, infection, nutrition, toxins, or a
                    disease such as diabetes.&nbsp; The peripheral
                    nervous system includes:</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensory
                    nerves that receive feelings such as heat, pain or
                    touch</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motor
                    nerves that control how your muscles move</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Autonomic
                    nerves that control such automatic functions as
                    blood pressure, heart rate, digestion and bladder
                    function</p>
                  <p>With a wide variety of causes and a number of
                    different nerve types there are a number of
                    different forms of peripheral neuropathy.&nbsp; For
                    instance carpel tunnel syndrome is one type of this
                    disease.&nbsp; Another more common form is
                    peripheral polyneuropathy which usually affects the
                    feet and legs.&nbsp; Common symptoms are numbness or
                    loss of sensation, tingling or burning, pain, or
                    loss of muscle control.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>If the autonomic nerves are affected this causes
                    problems with involuntary functions leading to
                    symptoms such as abnormal blood pressure and heart
                    rate, reduced ability to perspire, constipation,
                    bladder dysfunction (e.g., incontinence), and sexual
                    dysfunction.</p>
                  <p>Note: <em>Some note that oils used with the
                      massage technique for Neuropathy are also
                      effective for swollen ankles from other causes.</em></p>

                  <h3 class="text-align-center"><strong>Suggested
                      protocols:</strong></h3>
                  <p>Essential oils may be used to help with
                    uncomfortable symptoms as well as help strengthen
                    the body's own systems to repair or correct damaged
                    nerve tissue.&nbsp; For feet and leg problems Dr.
                    David Hill in a lecture suggested the following as
                    helps:</p>
                  <p>This process is basically creating “angiogenesis”,
                    which is the stimulation and creation of new
                    vascular tissue. It will take several weeks, and
                    maybe even months, depending on the length and depth
                    of the starving tissues affected. You are basically
                    ‘creating’ the need for blood flow to the area’s
                    affected. It is most effective on patients with
                    diabetic neuropathy, but others can find relief from
                    this process. He said three things are important in
                    this process: Exercise (or stimulation for
                    circulation), heat, and massage.</p>
                  <p>Using fractionated coconut oil to spread, apply a
                    couple of drops of&nbsp; Massage Blend&nbsp; to calf
                    area .Other oils that were recommended are:&nbsp;
                    Marjoram, Cypress, Peppermint, Wintergreen, Basil,
                    Grapefruit, Lavender. Anything that has circulatory
                    properties can be used. (Each patient may be
                    different) The entire process should only take about
                    10 minutes each leg.</p>
                  <p>As you start, you may notice how ‘hard’ the calf
                    muscle is. That is also a sign of neuropathy. Prop
                    the leg up on the edge of your knee. Start at the
                    top of calf, in the ‘hollow’ part of the leg (see
                    diagram).</p>
                  <p>Massage in small circular motions down the calf
                    towards the foot. Repeat several times on both sides
                    of calf. (you may also use a small hand held
                    massager) You may feel hard crystals, like bumps in
                    area. Try to work those out. It may be painful for
                    patient at First.</p>
                  <p>Now, flex the foot, and apply oils to bottom of
                    foot. Then massage the areas of the foot show on the
                    diagram below.&nbsp; Follow the arrows on the
                    diagram.&nbsp; You may also feel crystals in these
                    areas as well, massage them out.&nbsp; You will be
                    massaging towards the toes. This routine creates the
                    ‘need’ for blood to flow to these areas.</p>
                  <p>The top area is at the base of the toes (metatarsal
                    arch).&nbsp; When you flex the foot, you will see a
                    natural “T” in the area that is where the arrows
                    are.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;After massaging these areas (about 10
                    minutes) apply a warm compress to the area (such as
                    a rice or cracked corn bag) and leave it on for
                    about 10 minutes on each leg.</p>
                  <p>Do same application on opposite leg and foot area.
                    The key to success in this application is
                    CONSISTENCY!</p>
                  <p>He also recommended they take the Life Long
                    Wellness supplements to stabilize the body, as well
                    as placing Basil on the bottom of the feet in the
                    morning. Coriander could also be taken internally to
                    help with blood sugar levels. Those who have severe
                    blood sugar issues should monitor those levels. As
                    with anything, a proper diet, and at least 20-30
                    minutes of exercise every day is necessary to help
                    body to heal.</p>

                  <p>Also attributed to Dr. Hill is this more simplified
                    procedure for “neuropathy of the feet”:</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rub
                    2-4 drops Grounding Blend into the feet</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rub
                    2-4 drops&nbsp; each of Basil, Cypress, and Marjoram
                    into one foot</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finish
                    with 2-4 drops Peppermint then cover with hot moist
                    towel and perhaps a dry towel to keep the heat in
                    for the longest time.</p>
                  <p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat
                    on other foot.</p>
                </div>
