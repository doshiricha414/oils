                  <p><strong>Autism</strong> is a developmental disorder
                    that affects the way a child communicates and
                    interacts.&nbsp; It can be generalized as ASD
                    (autism spectrum disorder) that includes a range of
                    different manifestations that varying in degree of
                    severity.&nbsp; ASD includes Asperger’s syndrome
                    (high-functioning autism), autism, and PDD-NOS
                    (pervasive developmental disorders-not otherwise
                    specified).<br>

                      Checklist</span></h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Difficulty mixing with other children</li>
                    <li>No real fear of danger</li>
                    <li>Tantrums: displays extreme distress for no

                    <li>May not want cuddling or act cuddly</li>

                  </ul>
                  <p>One of the notable differences some have noted is
                    that those with autism do not learn well from
                    experience (or coping) but rather by rote or
                    memorization.&nbsp; Most love structure and will
                    repeat very well learned structure.&nbsp; On the
                    other hand those with ADHD will learn from
                    experiences and are able to extrapolate this
                    learning to other experiences. It is believed the
                    root causes of the two disorders are different but
                    since they are both developmental disorders and both
                    affect children in communication, social
                    interaction, and behavioral characteristics they can
                    be confused and even misdiagnosed.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p> <strong>ADHD </strong>
                    (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) is a
                    neurobehavioral disorder that causes an inability to
                    focus and listen to direction.&nbsp; In older
                    literature the term ADD or “ADD with hyperactivity”
                    was used for this same disorder. Attention
                    deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a
                    neurobehavioral disorder that affects 3-5 percent of
                    all American children. It interferes with a person's
                    ability to stay on a task and to exercise
                    age-appropriate inhibition (cognitive alone or both
                    cognitive and behavioral). Some of the warning signs
                    of ADHD include failure to listen to instructions,
                    inability to organize oneself and school work,
                    fidgeting with hands and feet, talking too much,
                    leaving projects, chores and homework unfinished,
                    and having trouble paying attention to and
                    responding to details. … ADHD is usually diagnosed
                    in childhood, although the condition can continue
                    into the adult years.<br>

                  <p><strong>Note -</strong> Since many with ADD/ADHD,
                    Asperser's, or autism are highly sensitive to odors
                    and sometime touch do not force the application of
                    oils if it is a negative experience as this will
                    build a experiential resentment towards their use in
                    the future. Many times it is successful letting them
                    make their own selection from a few choices of oils.</p>

                      success with this simple blend.</li>

                      proper brain function.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Application - </strong>These oils and
                    blend can be inhaled or carried via the blood
                    stream. For the latter applied topically to the feet
                    is effective or with a light massage action along
                    the spine. Dr. David Hill also recommends applying
                    the oils to in regions that are in close proximity
                    to the sources of blood flow to the brain. Two he
                    specifically mentions are on the areas of the right
                    and left jugular just below the chin on the front
                    and each side of the neck. The other is the
                    suboccipital triangle which not only gives proximity
                    to arterial flow to the brain but also key
                    neurological tissue. He describes finding this by
                    placing the fingers on the sub occipital
                    protuberance (little bump at the top of the spine on
                    the back of the neck) then just below this grip the
                    large muscle tissue and roll the fingers off to the
                    side. This depression just behind and below the ear
                    is the suboccipital triangle and the location Dr.
                    Hill suggests is an excellent place to topically
                    applies these oils and blends.</p>
                  <p>The early writers on use of essential oils (Valnet,
                    Tisserand, Gassefosse) came before our modern era
                    where this type of disorder has become so
                    common.&nbsp; For that reason there is no
                    information from them on the use of oils.&nbsp; More
                    recent essential oils users have documented their
                    successes in using oils to address the symptoms
                    often experienced by those with ADHD. Summarized
                    below are some of their recommendations:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>For frustration, impatience, and anger use oils
                      and blends that calm.&nbsp; Grounding Blend,
                      Calming Blend, Frankincense, Lavender, Ylang
                      Ylang.&nbsp; Applying to the feet, back of the
                      neck, behind the knees, and diffusion are all
                      suggested.</li>
                    <li>For improved concentration the oil
                      Vetiver.&nbsp; Again on the feet or, for school
                      children that need help during the school day, a
                      necklace with a pendant that will absorb the oil
                      will make it available all day.</li>
                    <li>Some, with autism, are particularly sensitive to
                      smell and may resist the use of oils.&nbsp;
                      Applying to the feet, even after they are asleep,
                      can circumvent this problem.</li>
                    <li>Also go to the “Especially for Kids” tab to read
                      the experiences of others directly.&nbsp; There
                      are good suggestions on “touch” and support (some
                      are very moving and helpful). One mentions the
                      method of letting the child smell a number of
                      different oils and blends and look for those
                      giving a positive reaction. Her child responded to
