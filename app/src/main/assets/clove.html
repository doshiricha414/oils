    <p><span class="label1">Clove</span> oil is much more than just a
      popular cooking spice, with its sweet, spicy fragrance; it is a
      favorite among health care professionals and health conscious
      individuals alike, for its many useful and healing
      properties.&nbsp; With powerful antioxidant properties, <span
        class="label1">clove</span> supports a healthy immune
      system.&nbsp; It also helps to promote circulation and support
      cardiovascular health, and it promotes oral health. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="label1">Clove</span> oil is steam distilled from
        the aromatic flower buds the <em class="noLink">Eugenia
          caryophyllata</em> tree, in the family <span class="noLink">Myrtaceae</span>.&nbsp;
        It yields an oil with a very spicy, warm, woody aroma, with
        subnote of leather.&nbsp; This makes it excellent for use in
        cooking, in place of the dried spice.&nbsp; It adds a spicy
        flavor to any dish or dessert, while providing important
        internal health benefits. </p>
      <p>One of <span class="label1">clove</span> oil's principal
        constituents is <em class="noLink">eugenol</em>, which can
        promote circulation and support cardiovascular health.&nbsp;
        But, due to its high phenol content, caution should be taken
        when inhaling <span class="label1">clove</span> directly; and
        it should be diluted when applied to the skin. </p>
