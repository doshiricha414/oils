                  <h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3>
                  <p>Because migraines are so individual and varied that
                    the oils to use will also vary.&nbsp; Listed here
                    are protocols that have worked for others.&nbsp; <br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Start as soon as any warning appears.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 1 - 2 drops of Frankincense on
                    your finger and rub on the roof of your mouth</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Roll Tension Blend on the back
                    of the neck and the base of the skull</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 1 - 2 drops of Soothing Blend
                    on the temples and forehead.&nbsp; Also Soothing
                    Blend can be applied to the neck and shoulder
                    region.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 1 - 2 drops Digestive Blend
                    internally if nauseous.</p>
                  <p>Repeat every 15 minutes - 2 hours as long as
                    necessary.&nbsp; Nap if situation allows.</p>
                  <p>Experience Two - simple:</p>
                  <p>Start as soon as any warning appears.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; 1 - 2 drops of Tension Blend
                    on the forehead</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Continue Tension Blend over
                    the crown of the head through the hair to the neck
                    and shoulders</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Rub into each area</p>
                  <p>Repeat every 15 minutes - 2 hours as long as
                    necessary.&nbsp; Nap if situation allows.</p>
                  <p>Massage while suffering from a migraine usually is
                    not a pleasant option. Applying the oil or blend as
                    a foot massage may be tolerable. Because root cause
                    and personal reactions are so varied it will take
                    personal experience to find the optimum solution for
                    each individual.</p>
                  <p>Having a foundation of healthy diet and rest is
                    important.&nbsp; The Life Long Vitality supplements
                    will help provide this.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Migraine headaches are a moderate to severe
                    throbbing sensation that lasts a few hours or
                    sometimes for days.&nbsp; The precise reason for
                    this type of headache is not know but one
                    description of the sequence of physiological events
                    is as follows:</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Migraine headache is
                    caused by vasodilatation (enlargement of blood
                    vessels) that causes the release of chemicals from
                    nerve fibers that coil around the large arteries of
                    the brain. Enlargement of these blood vessels
                    stretches the nerves that coil around them and
                    causes the nerves to release chemicals. The
                    chemicals cause inflammation, pain, and further
                    enlargement of the artery. The increasing
                    enlargement of the arteries magnifies the pain.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Migraine attacks commonly
                    activate the sympathetic nervous system in the body.
                    The sympathetic nervous system is often thought of
                    as the part of the nervous system that controls
                    primitive responses to stress and pain, the
                    so-called "fight or flight" response, and this
                    activation causes many of the symptoms associated
                    with migraine attacks; for example, the increased
                    sympathetic nervous activity in the intestine causes
                    nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.</p>
                  <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sympathetic activity also
                    delays emptying of the stomach into the small
                    intestine and thereby prevents oral medications from
                    entering the intestine and being absorbed.</p>
                  <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The impaired absorption of oral
                    medications is a common reason for the
                    ineffectiveness of medications taken to treat
                    migraine headaches.</p>
                  <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The increased sympathetic
                    activity also decreases the circulation of blood,
                    and this leads to pallor of the skin as well as cold
                    hands and feet.</p>
                  <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The increased sympathetic
                    activity also contributes to the sensitivity to
                    light and sound sensitivity as well as blurred
                    vision.</p>
                  <p><br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some sufferers from migraines say that there are
                    signs that signal when a migraine headache is coming
                    on.&nbsp; This includes signs such as tingling,
                    light flashes, or other warnings that can suggest
                    taking some preventative measures.&nbsp; For many
                    the headache is accompanied by sensitivity to light,
                    loud sounds, and may include an upset stomach or
                    even nausea.</p>
                  <p>Triggers for migraines vary from person to person
                    and are not always predictable (do not always
                    trigger the migraine) in an individual.&nbsp; Some
                    of the reported triggers for migraines include:
                    stress, sleep disturbance, fasting, dehydration,
                    dietary changes, hormone changes, bright or flashing
                    lights, allergies, chocolate, wine, certain odors,
                    cigarette smoke, and caffeine.</p>
                  <p>An important step in helping with migraines is to
                    determining from experience for an individual what
                    triggers their migraines. By finding the triggers,
                    one can anticipate them and use the habits of diet
                    and lifestyle coupled with the essential oils to
                    mitigate them.&nbsp;</p>
