    <p>Also known as <span class="noLink">lemon balm</span>, <span
        class="label1">melissa</span> oil supports and helps to boost a
      healthy immune system, helps to calm tension and nerves, promotes
      emotional and cognitive health, helping to initiate a restful
      night's sleep, and addresses the occasional stomach discomfort. </p>
    <p>One of the rarest and most expensive essential oils, it is also
      one of the most commonly <em>adulterated</em> of the oils. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Also known as <span class="noLink">lemon balm</span>, <span
          class="label1">melissa</span> has a delightful, light,
        lemon-like scent.&nbsp; This fresh, sweet, citrus-like
        fragrance, which was known to attract bees, led to its
        name.&nbsp; <span class="label1">Melissa</span> comes from the
        Greek word <span class="noLink">μέλισσα</span> (<em
          class="noLink">melissa</em>), meaning "honey bee", which in
        turn comes from <span class="noLink">μέλι</span> (<em
          class="noLink">meli</em>), meaning "honey". </p>
      <p><span class="label1">Melissa</span> essential oil is steam
        distilled from the fresh flowering tops, leaves and stems of the
        <span class="noLink"><em>Melissa officinalis</em></span> plant,
        yielding an oil with a distinctive citrus, herbaceous aroma,
        rich in the chemical compounds of <span class="noLink">geranial</span>,
        <span class="noLink">germacrene</span>, <span class="noLink">neral</span>,
        <span class="noLink">caryophyllene</span>.&nbsp; It was an
        important ingredient in Carmelite water, distilled in France
        since 1611, by members of the Carmelite Order. </p>
      <p>Because the <em class="noLink">Melissa officinalis</em> plant
        has an oil yield of less than 1/10 of 1%, <span class="label1">melissa</span>
        is one of the most rare and expensive oils.&nbsp; It takes <strong>three
          tons</strong> of<em class="noLink"> Melissa officinalis</em>
        to produce <strong>one pound</strong> of oil.&nbsp; <em>Quality</em>
        <span class="label1">melissa</span> oil, when you can get it,
        sells for $9,000 to $15,000 per kilo; which means that it is one
        of the most commonly <em>adulterated</em> of the essential
        oils. </p>
      <p><span class="label1">Melissa</span> has a wide range of health
        benefits and uses.&nbsp; It supports and helps to boost a
        healthy immune system; it helps to calm tension and nerves;
        diffusing <span class="label1">melissa</span> at night helps to
        initiate a restful sleep, and promotes emotional and cognitive
        health.&nbsp; It is also good at addressing occasional stomach
        discomfort.&nbsp; It is also used as a flavor in teas and ice
        cream, as well as with some fish dishes. </p>
