First because my growing collection of symptoms finally had a name. And secondly because that name was not Multiple Sclerosis (MS) which I secretly dreaded. &nbsp;On the worst of days, I reminded myself to be grateful for what it was because of what it wasn't.</p><p>When your body is attacking itself with wild abandon, terrifying complications can happen swiftly and multiply at random. So, all things considered, I've actually been pretty fortunate. My Lupus complaints were of the daily aggravation variety. Extreme Fatigue. Body Aches, Joint Pain &amp; Numbness that migrated everywhere. Significant Hair Loss. Low Grade Fevers. Cranial Swelling. UV Light Sensitivity. Pleurisy (Lung Inflammation) which gave me piercing Chest Pain &amp; made it difficult to breathe for weeks at a time.&nbsp;</p><p>There's no real medical help for moderate Lupus. I was occasionally offered Prednisone - a corticosteroid that takes more than it gives. There are a host of undesirable side effects and long term use has been proven to do more damage than the disease itself. So I said no to that and took my lumps. I went through periods of near-remission with only minor symptoms present. &nbsp;And, except for the constant hair loss, I even went into total remission for awhile. I had energy again. My pain &amp; inflammation all but vanished. It was like being reborn.&nbsp;</p><p>And then I got sick - again. It started out with a seriously debilitating cough that lingered for months at a time. Several Doctors shrugged it off, attributing it to Lupus without a second thought. For a few years, I agreed. But other symptoms began to stack up and they were different than before.&nbsp;The exhaustion returned but without the body aches. Instead, I had constant pain &amp; pressure that was concentrated in my throat.&nbsp;Loss of Appetite with extreme &amp; sudden Weight Loss/Gain, 20-40 lbs at a time. Cold Intolerance (freezing all the time - even in the middle of July!). Mental Fog with Aphasia (difficulty speaking). Heart Palpitations. Chest Pain. Shortness of Breath. Muscle Weakness.</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image sqs-col-6 span-6 float float-right" data-block-type="5" id="block-b4f3309d28f167df3fe9"><div class="sqs-block-content">

Luckily, I found one who took me seriously and ran all the necessary tests. The results showed that Chronic Lung Inflammation had caused me to lose 30% of my lung capacity, which in turn what had caused me to develop Cold Air Asthma - the real source of my never-ending cough. The treatment plan was simple and effective and it marked the first time I had received help of any kind after a decade of battling.</p><p>The Pulmonary Doc believed more could be done for me, so he referred me to an Ear Nose &amp; Throat guy.&nbsp;Although I had done a score of research by that point, I kept my opinions to myself so as not to sway his. He&nbsp;glanced at my list of symptoms &amp; labs and did a 10 second scope of my throat. And then he confirmed what I had already figured out for myself - Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. He was surprised that no one had diagnosed me with it sooner. He referred me to yet another Endocrinologist (Metabolic Specialist).</p><p>Even after an Ultrasound showed I had growths on my thyroid, the only treatment offered me was anti-depressants. In fact, at one point my Primary Care Doc went as far as to say that unless I agreed to take them on a trial basis, they would no longer be willing to treat me. &nbsp;The Endocrinologists I saw treated me even worse, refusing to even entertain the possibility that my Thyroid was malfunctioning, even though all my lab results &amp; symptoms practically screamed it.&nbsp;</p><p>I found no help in Conventional Medicine. &nbsp;And not for lack of trying. &nbsp;I went into my Doctor's appointments hoping to find a real-life version of Dr. House. Someone who wouldn't rest until the mystery was solved. &nbsp;But the truth is - most them weren't even the least bit interested. &nbsp;One day, it dawned on me: &nbsp;Nobody was as invested as I was. &nbsp;If I wanted to get well, I was going to have to be my own detective. &nbsp;I decided to educate myself so I could become the best advocate possible for myself.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image sqs-col-6 span-6 float float-left" data-block-type="5" id="block-ffe719066ca08f9a3da3"><div class="sqs-block-content">

Comforted &amp; encouraged me. I wasn't crazy, depressed, or a hypochondriac. And unlike Lupus, Hashimoto's had viable treatment options. For starters - a little white pill. Natural Thyroid Hormone replacement. The only problem? &nbsp;I could not get a Medical Doctor to prescribe it. It is standard procedure to just wait and see. Wait until my immune system completely decimates my Thyroid gland.</p><p>Only I couldn't sit still for that any longer. There was finally a treatment available and I wasn't going to just crawl back into a dark cave after I'd seen the light. So I got my hands on some Nature-throid and started on a grain a day. I felt the difference immediately. I got some mental clarity back and felt less fatigued. I started losing weight at a natural pace. And, most importantly - the pressure &amp; pain in my throat eased so much I sometimes forgot it was there. It was like I'd found a miracle drug.&nbsp;</p><p>A short time later, a friend with Adrenal Exhaustion referred me to her Naturopath, who specialized in Metabolic disorders. He patiently reviewed a full 5 years worth of Lab results &amp; laundry list of symptoms. He not only confirmed the Hashimoto's diagnosis but also told me that my Adrenals were extremely taxed. And the ultimate confirmation was, not only did I need to be taking Nature-throid, I wasn't taking enough.&nbsp;But before he upped my dosage, he gave me some homework. I was to take my temperature first thing in the morning, every day for 2 weeks. My body temperature was fluctuating between 96.4 and 98.1 (and that was only after an extremely hot shower). No wonder I was so desperately cold ALL THE TIME - my body was hypothermic on a daily basis!</p><p>Once I started taking a steady proper amount of Thyroid meds, my body temperature normalized. And my strength, energy &amp; stamina increased. It gave me a thirst for wellness. I decided to make significant changes to my diet. &nbsp;I eliminated processed sugar &amp; carbs. That's when I really started to feel great. Unfortunately, I feel off the wagon after about a year. &nbsp;A little white pill is no match for marginal nutrition. It didn't take long for my health slide. &nbsp;I'm nowhere near as sick as I was but I'm not yet as well as I could be.</p><p>I'm in the process of rebuilding my health, from the foundation up. I'm going to start by reducing - and then hopefully eliminating - any &amp; all possible external sources of chronic inflammation that are triggering my immune system to go on the offensive.&nbsp;If this something you are considering, I hope you'll be inspired to do the same!</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image" data-block-type="5" id="block-ac1eb7b2286f4e47652d"><div class="sqs-block-content">
