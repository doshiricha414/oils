    <p><span class="label1">Wintergreen</span> oil has a cool, mint-like
      fragrance that is readily <em>recognized</em> — if not actually <em>identified</em>
      — by most people today, due to its use as a flavoring agent in
      gum, candy and toothpaste.&nbsp; However, <span class="label1">wintergreen</span>
      has much more to offer, therapeutically.&nbsp; It soothes achy
      muscles and joints, and promotes healthy respiratory
      function.&nbsp; When diffused, its refreshing and cooling aroma
      evokes clarity, awareness and concentration. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="label1">Wintergreen</span> essential oil is
        derived from the leaves of a creeping shrub found in coniferous
        areas.&nbsp; Growing up to six inches in height, it contains
        bright red fruit, has oval leaves and small, white bell-shaped
        flowers. </p>
      <p><span class="label1">Wintergreen oil</span> is steam distilled
        from the small leaves of the <em class="noLink">Gaultheria
          procumbens</em> plant, yielding an oil with a sweet, minty,
        refreshing aroma, high in the chemical compound <span
          class="noLink">methyl salicylate</span>, a phenolic ester.
        While some producers also distill wintergreen oil from the bark
        of the <em>Gaultheria procumbens</em> tree, the best oil comes
        from the leaves. <span class="label1">Wintergreen</span> and <span
          class="noLink">birch</span> are the only plants in the world
        that contain natural <span class="noLink">methyl salicylate</span>.
      </p>
      <p>The main chemical component in <span class="label1">wintergreen</span>,
        <span class="noLink">methyl salicylate</span>, makes this oil
        very useful for soothing achy muscles and joints.&nbsp; When
        diffused, <span class="label1">wintergreen</span> promotes
        healthy respiratory function, and its refreshing and cooling
        aroma evokes clarity, awareness and concentration. </p>
      <h3>Primary benefits of wintergreen oil </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Soothes achy muscles and joints </li>
        <li>Promotes healthy respiratory function </li>
        <li>Frequently used in gum, candy, and toothpaste for flavoring

      </ul>
      <h3>Uses for wintergreen oil </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="label1">Wintergreen</span> has a warming
          effect, when applied to skin, and is excellent to use in a
          massage, to soothe sore muscles and joints.&nbsp; However, a
          little goes a long way; so use sparingly, and dilute with
          fractionated coconut oil, to help minimize any possible skin
          sensitivity. </li>
        <li>For a soothing bath, add 1 - 2 drops of <span
            class="label1">wintergreen</span> essential oil to warm bath
          water.&nbsp; Note: This oil should be added to a bath gel or
          salts, before adding it to bath water, to protect against
          "puddling" on sensitive areas of the body. </li>
        <li><span class="label1">Wintergreen</span> essential oil is not
          recommended for internal use and should be stored out of reach
          from children. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How to use </h3>
      <p><span class="label1">Wintergreen</span> oil is intended for
        aromatic or topical use.&nbsp; While not necessarily required
        for any one, except those with sensitive skin, dilution is
        strongly recommended when using topically. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="label1">Diffusion:</span> Use three to four
          drops in the diffuser of your choice. </li>
        <li><span class="label1">Topical use:</span> Apply one to two
          drops to desired area.&nbsp; Dilution with carrier oil will
          help to minimize any possible skin sensitivity.&nbsp; See
          additional precautions below. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="label1">Cautions:</span> Possible skin
        sensitivity.&nbsp; Keep out of reach of children.&nbsp; If you
        are pregnant, nursing, or under a doctor's care, consult your
        physician.&nbsp; Avoid contact with eyes, inner ears and
        sensitive areas. </p>
