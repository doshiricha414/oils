With that understanding the oils and protocols associated with the root cause will be of interest. With this said, there is a broad range of oils recommended for inflammation in general. The list below is taken from a brief review of recommendations made by a contemporary essential oils expert, Dr. David K. Hill. Reviewing some of his writings and lectures these are oils that were most often suggested for inflammation in general:</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most mentioned:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/helichrysum" class="button halfsize">Helichrysum</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/myrrh" class="button halfsize">Myrrh</a></span></p><p><span><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often mentioned: </strong><a href="#/tab/oils/basil" class="button halfsize">Basil</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/eucalyptusRadiata" class="button halfsize">Eucalyptus</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/ginger" class="button halfsize">Ginger</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/peppermint" class="button halfsize">Peppermint</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/wintergreen" class="button halfsize">Wintergreen</a></span></p><p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong> <a href="#/tab/info/massage-blend-technique" class="button halfsize"><a href="#/tab/info/massage-blend-technique" class="button halfsize">Massage Blend Technique</a></a>, Life Long Vitality supplements</p><p><span><strong>Also consider:</strong> </span></p><p><span><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discussed:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/cassia" class="button halfsize">Cassia</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/cinnamon" class="button halfsize">Cinnamon</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/clove" class="button halfsize">Clove</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/geranium" class="button halfsize">Geranium</a>, Jasmine, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemon" class="button halfsize">Lemon</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/oregano" class="button halfsize">Oregano</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/romanChamomile" class="button halfsize">Roman Chamomile</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/thyme" class="button halfsize">Thyme</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/ylangYlang" class="button halfsize">Ylang Ylang</a></span></p><p><span><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also discussed:</strong>&nbsp;Blue Tansy, <a href="#/tab/oils/cilantro" class="button halfsize">Cilantro</a>, Citrus Oils, <a href="#/tab/oils/clarySage" class="button halfsize">Clary Sage</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/coriander" class="button halfsize">Coriander</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/fennel" class="button halfsize">Fennel</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemongrass" class="button halfsize">Lemongrass</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/teaTree" class="button halfsize">Melaleuca</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/melissa" class="button halfsize">Melissa</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/patchouli" class="button halfsize">Patchouli</a>, Rose, <a href="#/tab/oils/sandalwood" class="button halfsize">Sandalwood</a></span></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>For chronic inflammation a foundation of balanced nutrition with the Life Long Vitality supplements is essential. For ongoing support the <a href="#/tab/info/massage-blend-technique" class="button halfsize">Massage Blend Technique</a> administered daily to weekly will be of great value. Specific chronic conditions are detailed under their own page on this website.</p><p>Acute inflammation conditions are also detailed under their own pages on this website. In general topical or internal use of the specific oils, generally from the lists above, is recommended.</p><p> </p><p>Inflammation in today’s common conversation is sometimes used interchangeably with infection. It is true that infection can lead to inflammation but it is not inflammation and inflammation can come from many other causes. Inflammation is the complex immune system protective response to an invasion of the body from a number of sources including infection.</p><p>Acute inflammation is the immediate and usually short-lived response to a strain, a wound, any irritant to body tissue or an infection from a agent such as bacteria, fungus or virus. Inflammation is the body’s normal response to bring protection and healing to the affected area.</p><p>Chronic inflammation might also be called a low-grade or systemic inflammation. This is inflammation that extends over months or years. It can come from an acute inflammation that was not resolved or a low level irritant that remains persistently present affecting the body. Maybe the most common source of chronic inflammation is when the immune system itself mistakenly attacks the body. This is known as an autoimmune disease and the associated long-term inflammation makes these diseases so difficult.</p><p>The body’s immune system response of inflammation, although harmful in the case of chronic conditions, is a very necessary process for most acute situations. The responses are quite complex and include the release of inflammatory mediators that allow the small blood vessels in the area to expand to increase blood flow as well as increase the permeability of blood vessels so fluids can more easily flow into the injured area. Concurrently more fluids including white blood cells migrate to the area. Simultaneously the mediators send signals of pain to the brain. This increased blood supply to the area explains the redness, swelling and warmth associated with inflammation. The process is even more complex as the body sends proteins and enzymes to the area to facilitate healing. Not only are blood fluids involved but the mediators can facilitate the release of additional fluids from mucous membranes as well.</p><p>This inflammatory response is summarized by the mnemonic PRISH. This refers to these five signs:</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Pain - inflammatory mediators increase sensitivity to touch (pain) to help protect the area</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Redness - with the increased blood supply to the capillaries</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Immobility - there may be some loss of function</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Swelling - from the increase of fluid</p><p>&nbsp;<span>•</span>&nbsp; Heat - more blood in the area makes it feel warm</p><p>Not all inflammation will develop all five signs and with internal inflammation it may be difficult to see any of the signs.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
