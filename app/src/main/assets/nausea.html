                  <p>An “upset stomach” is a common symptom for a number
                    of problems. The discomfort can stem from a food
                    source, possibly a virus, or even a stress or
                    nervous situation. Addressing the symptom in many
                    situations will relax and relieve the person enough
                    that they can be comfortable while the body does its
                    natural work of dealing with the underlying problem.
                    In the case of a virus, essential oils are very good
                    antiviral agents and can be used to that end. During
                    those periods when viral infections are being spread
                    among school children and the work place it is good
                    to use the essential oils precautions described
                    under cold and flu, to limit exposure to the common
                    viruses. If someone has a viral infection, taking
                    diluted essential oils like Cinnamon and Oregano in
                    capsule form can be very effective.</p>

                  <h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3>
                  <p><strong>Constipation, Diarrhea, Upset Stomach:</strong>&nbsp;
                    2-5 drops Digestive Blend supplemented with 1-3
                    drops of Coriander or if Digestive Blend is not
                    available consider Coriander, Fennel, Ginger and/or
                    Peppermint.&nbsp; Consider any of the following
                    application techniques:</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Take internally with water,
                    juice, or a teaspoon of honey or agave.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Add oil or blend to a capsule,</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Rub on the abdomen, or for
                    children and those more sensitive rub on the tummy
                    with a <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; For small infants or very
                    sensitive skin apply to the bottoms of the feet.</p>
                  <p>Repeat as soon as 10 - 15 minutes if no relief is
                    experienced from the initial application.</p>
                  <p><strong>Motion Sickness, Nervous Stomach:&nbsp; </strong>The
                    same applications are very effective for some such
                    as travelers who suffer from motion sickness, people
                    who tend to get a “nervous stomach” before a public
                    presentation, or other nervous stomach
                    situations.&nbsp; Also consider one of these
                    following procedures an hour or so before or during
                    the occasion:</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Use 3-5 drops of Peppermint
                    and/or Ginger or Digestive Blend in a tissue cup or
                    inhaler and breathe it occasionally to help settle
                    the stomach.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Use 1 - 2 drops of Coriander
                    or other oils and apply behind ears.</p>
                  <p><strong>Chronic Indigestion:&nbsp; </strong>Add
                    Fennel to the regular use of the TerraZyme
                    supplement for a gentle way to help indigestion.
                    Simply add 2 - 3 drops of Fennel to a glass of water
                    and drink daily in addition to the regular use of
                    TerraZyme. Also consider a gastro-intestinal cleanse
                    with GX Assist/PB Assist+ (see Detoxification).</p>
