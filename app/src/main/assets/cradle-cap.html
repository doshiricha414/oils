Other common locations for these scales to form are the eyelids, around the nose and in the groin area. It is not a precursor or symptom of any other underlying health problem. In infants the build up of oils and skin cells coupled with the yeast malassezia causes the formation of the scales. For babies or adults, a number of other factors can be related: congenital (runs in families), over production of skin oil, lotions containing alcohol, and even stress or fatigue.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/geranium" class="button halfsize">Geranium</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/teaTree" class="button halfsize">Melaleuca</a></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/balance" class="button halfsize">Grounding Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemon" class="button halfsize">Lemon</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p style="margin-left:.5in"><span>路</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mix one drop of Lavender (or Melaleuca or Geranium) with a small amount of <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil (coconut or olive oil) and apply topically to the scalp.
