    <p><span class="label1">Geranium</span> offers outstanding benefits

      nerves and lessen stress, as well as supporting liver health. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>A member of the <span class="noLink">Pelargonium</span> genus
        of flower species, <span class="noLink">geraniums</span> (<em
          class="noLink">Pelagronium graveolens</em>) are grown for
        their beauty, and as a staple of the perfume industry.&nbsp;
        While there are over 200 different varieties of <span
          class="noLink">Pelargonium</span> flowers, only a few are used
        as essential oils. </p>
      <p><span class="label1">Geranium</span> oil is steam distilled
        from the whole <em class="noLink">Pelagronium graveolens</em>
        plant, yielding an oil with an herbaceous, green, floral, sweet,
        dry aroma. </p>
      <p>The use of <span class="label1">geranium</span> essential oil
        dates back to antiquity, when the ancient Egyptians used it both
        to beautify skin and for its internal health benefits.&nbsp; In
        the Victorian era, fresh geranium leaves were placed at formal
        dining tables, as decorative pieces, and to be consumed as a
        fresh sprig if desired; in fact, the edible leaves and flowers
        of the plant are often used in desserts, cakes, jellies and
        teas. </p>
      <p>As an essential oil, <span class="label1">geranium</span> has
        been used to promote clear, healthy skin - making it ideal for
        skin care products.&nbsp; It also helps calm nerves, lessen
        stress and support liver health. </p>
