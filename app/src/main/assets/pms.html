                  <p>Hormone changes occur during the normal monthly
                    cycle resulting in a wide variety of symptoms
                    depending on the individual. Symptoms can include
                    physiological problems such as fluid retention,
                    swollen joints, skin problems, fatigue, or
                    headaches. Some may also experience psychological
                    reactions ranging from severe aggressive
                    irritability to irrationality, tension, insomnia,
                    decreased libido, depression, apathy, or
                    sadness.&nbsp; These symptoms vary widely in each
                    woman.&nbsp; They usually start 7 to 10 days prior
                    to menstrual flow and end shortly thereafter.&nbsp;
                    For most women, if not addressed, there will be a
                    similar pattern month to month.</p>
                  <p>PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder) is the term
                    used to describe severe PMS symptoms.&nbsp; They
                    follow the same cycle and range of symptoms but
                    produce a more debilitating outcome.&nbsp; To
                    clinically be PMDD the symptoms must include one
                    mood related symptom and five or more of the
                    following:</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Disinterest in daily
                    activities and relationships</p>

                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Feeling of sadness or
                    hopelessness, possible suicidal thoughts</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Feelings of tension or anxiety</p>

                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Physical symptoms, such as
