As the infection develops the windpipe (trachea) and voice box (larynx) become irritated and inflamed. This then leads to hoarseness and the harsh repetitive barking cough of the croup. Infants to children 3 or 4 are most likely to develop more severe symptoms and because of their smaller airways they are more likely to develop the characteristic cough.</p><p>Accompanying the barking cough there may be symptoms similar to a cold including a fever with stuffy or runny nose. During the first few days of the croup it is contagious and care should be taken not to pass it on to others.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/breathe" class="button halfsize">Respiratory Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/peppermint" class="button halfsize">Peppermint</a></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/lemon" class="button halfsize">Lemon</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/marjoram" class="button halfsize">Marjoram</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/thyme" class="button halfsize">Thyme</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>With 6 - 12 drops of <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oil apply 2 drops each Respiratory Blend, Frankincense and Peppermint to the child's chest area (dilute more for infants). The blend of oils may also be applied to the bottoms of the feet and back as well. Repeat every 1 to 3 hours until the coughing stops. Protect small children from transferring the oils from their chest, etc. to their eyes.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
