                  <p>Headaches can be triggered by many different
                    conditions but the typical result is the nerves in
                    the head muscles and blood vessels of the head
                    signal the brain that there is pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
                    triggers can be anything from a blow to the head,
                    disease, to emotional distress.&nbsp; There are many
                    different types of headaches documented in the
                    literature (over 150) but the most common are:</p>
                  <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tension headaches –</strong>
                    These are the most common headache that most people
                    will experience from time to time.&nbsp; Tightness
                    is felt in areas around the head that results in
                    mild to moderate pain.&nbsp; The more common areas
                    are the back of the neck, the temples, or the
                    forehead.&nbsp; The cause is not yet fully
                    understood.</p>
                  <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chronic daily headaches
                      –</strong> If there are repeated tension headaches
                    from day to day it is labeled chronic daily
                    headaches.</p>
                  <p><strong>&nbsp;Migraine headache -&nbsp;</strong> A
                    migraine is a much more painful experience.&nbsp;
                    This can be a moderate to severe throbbing sensation
                    that lasts a few hours or sometimes for days.&nbsp;
                    Again the precise reason for this type of headache
                    is not yet know.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cluster headaches – </strong>This


                    is one of the most severe of headaches.&nbsp; The
                    name is because they come in repeated frequent
                    attacks or “cluster periods”.&nbsp; The attacks may
                    be 2 or 3 times a day and may last from weeks to
                    months.&nbsp; They may then go away for months or
                    even years.&nbsp; They often begin in the middle of
                    the night while someone is asleep.&nbsp; The pain is
                    usually on one side of the head or the other and
                    typically right behind the eye.&nbsp; The pain is
                    intense, constant, and throbbing making it almost
                    impossible to function normally.</p>
                  <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sinus headaches –</strong>
                    When the membranes of the sinus cavities become
                    inflamed and swollen there can be pressure around
                    the eyes, cheeks, and forehead area where these
                    cavities are located.&nbsp; This pressure then can
                    result in a sinus headache.</p>
                  <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acute headaches –</strong>
                    Typically seen in children these headaches come on
                    suddenly and last for a short time.</p>
                  <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hormone headaches – </strong>Changing


                    hormone levels during menstruation, pregnancy, or
                    menopause may trigger headaches.&nbsp; This may also
                    include hormone changes with medications such as
                    birth control pills.</p>
                  <p>Essential oils have a well-deserved reputation for
                    helping with headaches.</p>

                  <h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3>
                  <p><strong>Mild tension headache:</strong></p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; A drop or two of Peppermint
                    oil rubbed on the temples, forehead, and/or back of
                    neck is a simple and effective solution for most.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Tension Blend is a blend of
                    oils in a handy roll on dispenser that is also very
                    effective and more convenient.</p>
                  <p><strong>Sinus headaches:</strong></p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; To relieve immediate pain
                    Tension Blend or Peppermint as described above will
                    be helpful.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Also attend to the sinus
                    infection as described under Sinus Infections.</p>
                  <p><strong>More severe headaches:</strong></p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Use Peppermint or Tension
                    Blend as described previously but follow with a
                    damp, cool compress using a clean hand towel. Apply
                    this compress to the forehead and closed eyes and/or
                    the back of the neck, while resting for a few
                    minutes. Repeat as often as needed and schedule will
                    permit.&nbsp; A few drops of an oil may be put
                    directly on the damp towel to extend the help.&nbsp;
                    Keep oils away from eyes.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Equal parts Frankincense,
                    Lavender and Peppermint applied to temples, back of
                    neck, crown of head and inhaled is highly
                    recommended.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Some will find an inhaler or
                    using cup and inhale may prove advantageous.</p>
                  <p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Different bodies and
                    conditions will respond differently to oils.
                    Sometimes it is necessary to rotate or try different
                    oils. Consider Frankincense, Wintergreen or other
                    oils listed above.</p>
