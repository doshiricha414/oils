    <p> <span class="label1">Lemon oil</span> is sometimes referred to
      as "Liquid Sunshine", and for good reason.&nbsp; It smells like
      sunshine in a bottle.&nbsp; It is versatile, with a
      well-established history for its use.&nbsp; It's an aromatic
      powerhouse, useful for everything from cleansing and purifying
      surfaces to promoting a more positive mood and cognitive ability,
      while supporting healthy respiratory function. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Originating in China, the <em class="noLink">Citrus limon</em>
        tree, and its fruit, quickly spread throughout all the ancient
        world.&nbsp; It was established in the New World in the 1400s,
        arriving with Columbus.&nbsp; (Today, Italy is still one of the
        best sources for <span class="label1">lemon</span> oil; our <span
          class="label1">lemon</span> oil is sourced from Sicily.)&nbsp;
        The fruit has long been associated with freshness and
        cleanliness; and now, many products are advertised as "lemon
        scented" to entice buyers.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="label1">Lemon</span> oil, as with most citrus oil,
        is <em>not</em> steam distilled, as are most other essential
        oils; instead, it is cold pressed (expressed) from the rinds
        (peels) of the <span class="noLink"><em>Citrus limon</em></span>
        fruit, yielding an oil with a clean, bright, fresh, citrus
        aroma, high in the chemical compounds of <span class="noLink">d-Limonene</span>
        and <span class="noLink">α-</span> and <span class="noLink">β-pinenes</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cold pressing preserves <span class="label1">lemon</span> oil's
        delicate nature and potent properties. </p>
      <p>Like <em>all</em> pure essential oils, <span class="label1">lemon</span>
        has a <em>complete</em> chemical profile, just as it did in
        nature.&nbsp; Among its chemical constiuents, one of the most <em>impressive</em>
        is <span class="noLink">d-limonene</span>, which has been
        extensively researched for its antioxidant benefits, in helping
        to ward off free radical damage to the cells.&nbsp; (All citrus
        oils contain <span class="noLink">limonene</span>, as a major
        component of their chemical structure.) </p>
      <p>Today, <span class="label1">lemon</span> — as are citrus oils,
        in general — is widely accepted; and <span class="label1">FDA</span>
        has approved it for ingestion.&nbsp; When added to water, <span
          class="label1">lemon</span> provides a refreshing and healthy
        boost, throughout the day.&nbsp; It can also be added to food,
        to enhance the flavor of desserts and main dishes.&nbsp; Due to
        its high <span class="noLink">limonene</span> content, <span
          class="label1">lemon</span> is a powerful antioxidant, that
        can help ward off free radicals.&nbsp; Taken internally, it
        provides cleansing and digestive benefits, can soothe an
        irritated throat, and supports healthy respiratory function, to
        assist with seasonal respiratory discomfort. </p>

      <h3>Uses for lemon oil</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Diffuse, and take internally, to support healthy respiratory
          function. </li>
        <li>Add <span class="label1">lemon</span> oil to a spray bottle
          of water, to cleanse and purify tables, counter tops and other
          surfaces. </li>
        <li>Use as a great furniture polish.&nbsp; Simply add a few
          drops to olive oil, to clean, protect and shine wood finishes.
        </li>
        <li>Use a cloth, soaked in <span class="label1">lemon</span>
          oil, to preserve and protect your leather furniture and other
          leather surfaces or garments. </li>
        <li>Use on silver, and other metals, as a great remedy for the
          early stages of tarnish. </li>
        <li>Mix 6 drops of <span class="label1">lemon</span> oil and 6
          drops of the Clensing oil blend in a spray bottle, along with
          distilled water, shake well to disperse the oils and spray
          into the air, to help freshen the air in the bathroom. </li>
        <li>To remove gum, oil, grease spots or crayon, rub with 1-2
          drops of <span class="label1">lemon</span> oil. </li>
        <li>Use 1 drop of <span class="label1">lemon</span> oil to add
          flavor to baked goods or beverages. </li>
        <li>For homemade lemonade, mix 2 drops of <span class="label1">lemon</span>
          oil with 2 tablespoons of honey and two cups of pure water in
          a blender.&nbsp; Adjust the amount of each ingredient to suit
          your own taste. </li>
        <li>To clean and increase the shelf life of fresh fruit, fill a
          bowl with cool water and 2-3 drops of <span class="label1">lemon</span>
          oil.&nbsp; Drop your cleaned fruit into the water and
          stir.&nbsp; Be sure all surfaces of the fruit contact the
          lemon water.&nbsp; If you have an apple, and only want to eat
          half of it at that time, you can also put a drop of <span
            class="label1">lemon</span> oil on the part you want to
          save.&nbsp; It will prevent oxidation (browning) of the fruit,
          and adds a really nice flavor to the apple. </li>
        <li>To cleanse and purify cutting boards, counter tops,
          cupboards and table tops, add 2-3 drops of <span
            class="label1">lemon</span> oil to water and spray them. </li>
        <li>To cleanse and purify your dishcloth, soak it overnight in a
          bowl of water with a drop of <span class="label1">lemon</span>
          oil. </li>

          hands, after using a public bathroom. </li>
        <li>Use a paper towel, soaked with several drops of <span
            class="label1">lemon</span> oil, to cleanse and purify
          bathroom fixtures. </li>
        <li>Rub a drop of <span class="label1">lemon</span> oil to
          cleanse and purify a butcher's block, or other cutting
          surfaces. </li>
        <li>Put 10-15 drops of <span class="label1">lemon</span> oil in
          each gallon of carpet cleaning solution.&nbsp; This also
          leaves a fresh smell in the room.&nbsp; Mixing several drops
          of <span class="label1">lemon oil</span> into baking soda,
          and sprinkling it over the carpet before vacuuming is also
          very effective.&nbsp; <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How to use </h3>
      <p><span class="label1">Lemon</span> oil is intended for aromatic,
        topical or dietary use.&nbsp; It is gentle enough to be used
        neat. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="label1">Diffusion:</span> Use three to four
          drops in the diffuser of your choice.&nbsp; One of the easiest
          ways to receive <span class="label1">lemon oil</span>'s
          remarkable properties is aromatically, through diffusion or
          direct inhalation.&nbsp; </li>
        <li><span class="label1">Internal use:</span> Dilute one drop in
          4 fl oz of liquid, like to a glass of water, for a quick
          energizing boost.</li>
        <li><span class="label1">Topical use:</span> Apply one to two
          drops to desired area, like to the bottom of the feet.&nbsp;
          While gentle enough to be used neat, dilution with carrier oil
          will help to minimize any possible skin sensitivity.&nbsp; See
          additional precautions below. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="label1">Cautions:</span> Possible skin
        sensitivity.&nbsp; Keep out of reach of children.&nbsp; If you
        are pregnant, nursing, or under a doctor's care, consult your
        physician.&nbsp; Avoid contact with eyes, inner ears, and
        sensitive areas. &nbsp; Avoid sunlight or UV rays for up to 12
        hours after applying product. </p>
