    <div id="content">Every essential oil contains an <em>amazing</em>
      array of aromatic molecules.&nbsp; They give the oil its powerful
      potential for healing.&nbsp; They are also what gives it its
      distinctive fragrance and its energizing frequency.&nbsp; And,
      while fragrance <em>itself</em> can have <em>profound</em>
      effects upon our emotions, these aromatic molecules, because of
      their chemical make-up, have many <em>other</em> effects, as
      well.<br>
      <br>
      <div class="feature">Chemists have identified more than 3,000
        aromatic molecules.&nbsp; Each of these has specific therapeutic
        actions upon the body. Even a fairly <em>simple</em> essential
        oil may contain anywhere from 80 to 300 different chemical
        constituents.&nbsp; Many of an oil's constituents occur in <em>very</em>
        minute quantities; but, <em>all</em> contribute important
        qualities to the oil, having a synergistic impact on its
        therapeutic effects. Many of these chemical compounds have been
        identified, and new ones are being discovered; but, many still
        remain unknown, and the relationships between them are not well
        understood. <br>
        <br>
        These molecules can be grouped together into families, each with
        its own therapeutic properties:<br>

        <h3><strong>The therapeutic action of essential oils preserves
            the body's natural balance</strong></h3>
        <p>Because of their chemical complexity, essential oils don't
          disturb the body's natural balance — or homeostasis.&nbsp; If
          one constituent exerts too strong an effect in one direction,
          another constituent may block or counteract it.&nbsp; For
          example: certain aromatic molecules in an oil may be very
          stimulating — both psychologically and physically.&nbsp; But,
          the <em>same</em> essential oil may <em>also</em> contain
          constituents that are calming and sedating, helping to
          overcome anxious feelings or agitation. </p>
        <p>And, because the oils are natural substances, they tend to go
          only where they're needed, and provide <em>only</em> the
          action needed to help restore the body's natural
          balance.&nbsp; The same oil may have significantly different
          effects on a person from one application to the next,
          depending on his/her need at that moment.&nbsp; This quality
          of essential oils makes aromatherapy very safe and,
          incidentally, makes choosing the right oil less problematic. </p>
        <p>This is in stark contrast to synthetic chemicals, which often
          interrupt the body's homeostasis, forcing an action based upon
          the <em>chemical's</em> make-up, not on what the <em>body
            needs</em>. </p>
        <p>Another interesting point: While it's possible to duplicate
          these chemical constituents in the laboratory and blend them
          together into a concoction that <em>smells</em> like an
          essential oil, scientists have yet to duplicate the <em>therapeutic
            effects</em> of a truly therapeutic-grade essential oil.
          Chemically, essential oils are very heterogeneous, giving the
          same oil many diverse effects within the body.&nbsp; A single
          essential oil can play <em>many</em> different therapeutic
          roles.&nbsp; This is very different than the effects of
          synthetic chemicals, which have only a single action. </p>
