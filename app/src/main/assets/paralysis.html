A stroke is the most common cause of paralysis but it can occur because of an injury, most often to the neck or spine.&nbsp; Diseases of the nervous system, some autoimmune disorders, other diseases and certain medications can also result in partial paralysis. Paralysis can affect a single muscle, a muscle group or an entire area of the body depending on the nerves disturbed. If both the motor nerves and sensory nerves are damaged both mobility and the sense of feeling can be affected.</p><p><strong>Oils &amp; Blends:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="#/tab/oils/balance" class="button halfsize">Grounding Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/cypress" class="button halfsize">Cypress</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/frankincense" class="button halfsize">Frankincense</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/geranium" class="button halfsize">Geranium</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/helichrysum" class="button halfsize">Helichrysum</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/peppermint" class="button halfsize">Peppermint</a></p><p><strong>Essential oils based products:</strong> <a href="#/tab/info/massage-blend-technique" class="button halfsize"><a href="#/tab/info/massage-blend-technique" class="button halfsize">Massage Blend Technique</a></a></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> <a href="#/tab/oils/basil" class="button halfsize">Basil</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/ginger" class="button halfsize">Ginger</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lavender" class="button halfsize">Lavender</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/lemongrass" class="button halfsize">Lemongrass</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/breathe" class="button halfsize">Respiratory Blend</a>, <a href="#/tab/oils/purify" class="button halfsize">Cleansing Blend</a></p><h3 class="text-align-center">Suggested protocols:</h3><p>For those with paralysis from a stroke also see Stroke.</p><p>Serious conditions require professional medical help.
