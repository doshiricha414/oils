In any case the length of time is weeks, not days, so be patient and consistent.&nbsp; It is not abnormal for the nail to turn yellow or black as it heals, do not be concerned. Replace emery boards and sterilize other manicure/pedicure tools.</p><p><strong>Mild - </strong>Apply 2 - 3 drops of the oil topically to the affected nail 2 - 4 times daily.&nbsp; Continue 2 weeks after it is healed to prevent the infection from returning.&nbsp; Suggested oils are:</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; Topical Blend</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; or Lemongrass</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; or Melaleuca and Oregano*</p><p><span>•</span>&nbsp; or combinations of the above oils and rotating them has been helpful for some</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; *Note: Oregano is termed a "hot" oil and can irritate the skin, especially if someone has sensitive skin. Consider diluting with a <a href="#/tab/info/carrier-oil" class="button halfsize">carrier</a> oils or only applying to the nails and avoiding skin contact.</p><p><strong>Moderate -</strong> For some the fungus infection is not just on the nails but is an internal candida infection and is best helped with the above protocol using the topical application combined with an internal cleanse of the candida.</p><p>Use the GX Assist/PB Assist protocol monthly (or more often to start with):&nbsp;</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1-3 GX Assist capsules daily with meals for 10 days</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow with probiotic PB Assist</p><p>This Candida Cleanse from Dr. Hill uses individual oils and was suggested before the GX Assist became available:</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 drops of Lemon</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 drops of Melaleuca</p><p><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 drops on Oregano (see note above)</p><p>Put the oils into a gel cap and take internally twice a day for 10-14 days, rest two weeks and repeat the procedure.</p><p><strong>Strong -</strong> Some have found that if they have a persistent candidiasis problem they need to couple the above protocols with a serious diet eliminating yeast and acidic foods.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
