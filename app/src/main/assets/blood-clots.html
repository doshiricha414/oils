                  <p>Blood clots are the bodyâ€™s natural protection to
                    stop bleeding from a cut or other injury.&nbsp; On
                    the other hand there are situations when blood clots
                    form within blood vessels that range in severity
                    from mild to dangerous.&nbsp; As the veins are
                    disturbed by the clot the condition of
                    thrombophlebitis or swelling of the veins can occur.
                    Clots that form inside the small veins near the
                    surface of the skin result in&nbsp; superficial
                    thrombophlebitis (or superficial phlebitis) and may
                    cause local pain, redness, and swelling but are not
                    dangerous.&nbsp; When blood coagulates inside larger
                    blood vessels or the heart and remains in place it
                    is called thrombus.&nbsp; The swelling of veins in
                    this situation is called deep vein thrombosis (or
                    DVT).</p>
                  <p>If such a blood clot dislodges and travels in the
                    blood vessel it is called an embolism and can result
                    in severe health concerns. The most dangerous of
                    embolism types include blood clots within the
                    arteries of the heart that cause a heart
                    attack.&nbsp; Blood clots in the heart or the main
                    artery to the brain (carotid) that then travel to
                    the brain give rise to a stroke.&nbsp; Or a blood
                    clot in a deep vein (often the legs) that then
                    travels to the lungs culminates in what is called a
                    pulmonary embolism.</p>
                  <p>Some of those most at risk for these types of
                    disorders are those that are obese, pregnant,
                    immobile, smokers and users of oral contraceptives.
                    Certain diseases, types of cancer and surgeries
                    increase the risk and there is some genetic
                    disposition and also increased risk for those over
                    60.</p>
                  <p>As noted above blood clots range from helpful to
                    very severe health situations.&nbsp; If you believe
                    you are potentially dealing with a severe type
                    immediately seek competent professional
                    assistance.&nbsp; There are a number of anecdotal
                    experiences of blood clots being reduced with
                    essential oils and research (see Science &amp;
                    Research tab) that report that with increased Omega
                    3 fatty acids such as essential oils based
                    supplements (Life Long Vitality) there is improved
                    cardiovascular health.</p>

                  <p>Consistent use of the Life Long Vitality
                    supplements improves the balance of Omega 3 and
                    Omega 6 fatty acids that is shown in research to
                    improve cardiovascular health. Proper hydration is
                    important, drink lots of water.</p>
                  <p>Deep vein thrombosis</p>
                  <p>Blood clots in major blood vessels can be life
                    threatening and should be treated with professional
                    medical attention. This can be coupled with helpful
                    essential oils as described under superficial
                    phlebitis below.</p>
                  <p>Superficial phlebitis (and DVT after clots are
                    addressed)</p>
                  <p>If painful: Lightly apply (do not massage or rub
                    oils directly) by patting or spraying soothing oils
                    along affected area. Some oils suggested are Massage
                    Blend, Soothing Blend rub and Peppermint.</p>
                  <p>Healing: Apply 2 - 3 drops each of Cypress and
                    Helichrysum to the bottoms of the feet 2 or 3 times
                    per day. Some have coupled this with the same oils
                    also taken internally in a capsule daily. If the
                    area is not painful the Cypress and Helichrysum can
                    be applied directly to the area and followed with a
                    hot compress to drive in the oils.</p>
                  <p>Note: Some find Helichrysum initially gives a
                    tingling or painful feeling as it heals but this is
                    temporary and will go away.</p>
