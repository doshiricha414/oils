      <em>eucalyptus</em> oils, has the distinctively airy, crisp,
      pungent, camphoraceous fragrance, typical of <em>eucalypus</em>
      oils; but, <span class="label1"><em>E. radiata</em></span> has a
      lighter, gentler quality, making it safe for use with children and

      healthy immune system function. </p>
