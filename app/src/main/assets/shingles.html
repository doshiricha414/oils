A common thread mentioned by those with success is a capsule taken internally 2 or 3 times daily with:</p><p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 drops Melaleuca</p><p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 drops Eucalyptus</p><p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 drops Lemon</p><p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 drops Oregano</p><p>Since each person is different also consider other combinations using Frankincense, Protective Blend, Wild Orange and/or Peppermint.&nbsp; Many of these oils are in the GX Assist so some may find using the GX Assist regiment during the attack sufficient.</p><p><strong>Pain during an attack.</strong>&nbsp; Oils that have been mentioned for topical application to ease the pain are Marjoram (most often mentioned), Frankincense, Geranium, Lavender and Wintergreen. Another successful protocol for pain and healing suggested is:</p><p>Spray topically directly to the affected area as often as necessary to address the pain:</p><p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30 drops Melaleuca</p><p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30 drops Eucalyptus</p><p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30 drops Lavender</p><p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span>·</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;add to 4 ounce spray bottle, fill with fractionated coconut oil, shake before spraying.</p><p>Two important suggestions.&nbsp; One is to make application less painful use a spritz (spray bottle) to apply the oils.&nbsp; Also, remember that often people who suffer from shingles, can have sensitive skin, so test the oils before using them and use a carrier when necessary.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
