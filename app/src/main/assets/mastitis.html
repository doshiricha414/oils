Repeat every hour the first day and every 2 hours the second day. Be aggressive and consistent.</p><p>Also take 2-4 drops each Frankincense and Protective Blend internally in a capsule every two hours. Stay away from the hot compress. It will spread the oil but it will also spread the infection.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
